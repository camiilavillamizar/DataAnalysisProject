This is an area of the glacier that is wind swept and does not accumulate snow. The first load was loaded and the aircraft lifted off to search for a new site by air. A suitable site was located 4 nm from the point of departure. On the return trip it was decided that once the fuel drums were loaded they would attempt to taxi the 4nm to the new site since it was so close. It was 1200 meters into this trip that the left main gear struck a snow covered hard packed snow drift causing the left main gear to slowly collapse.

While climbing out of MMMX through FL290 the crew heard a thud noise coming from the main cargo compartment. The crew also felt a pressure bump in their ears. Both crew immediately looked to the pressure controller and noticed that the cabin rate of climb was well exceeding 1000 feet per minute. Within seconds the cabin pressure altitude climbed in excess of 10000 feet causing the Cabin Altitude light to illuminate and horn to sound. The captain already in the Pilot Flying Position announced to the crew to don their oxygen masks and to establish communications. As the cabin was still climbing at a significant rate the crew declared a PAN PAN with ATC and requested an immediate descent. Initial descent clearance was given to FL200. An emergency descent was initiated. The aircraft was flying over mountainous terrain at night so considerations were made for this. The captain requested the QRH for Cabin Altitude. The crew discussed options and it was decided to return to MMMX. The captain utilized the PA to advise the ACMs to don their oxygen masks and advised them of the problem. ATC cleared the crew to PAZ and then to ENAGA for the ENAGA2B arrival for Runway 23L. This is the longest runway at MMMX. Further descent was given when safe and in accordance with the arrival procedure. The crew carried out the QRH procedures for Cabin Altitude and then Cabin Automatic Inoperative. These checklists did not prove able to establish any control of the aircraft pressurization although the first officer was able to manually move the outflow valve but to no effect. Oxygen masks were removed when cabin altitude was at a safe altitude. Arrival ATC cleared the aircraft for an approach and to switch to tower. The first officer would advise each subsequent controller that they had declared a PAN. The Tower controller advised the crew to maintain 160kias until MX402 the Final Approach Fix. They were number two to the runway for landing. Normal aircraft configuration was done and the QRH Landing Checklist was completed. The tower advised to continue as the previous aircraft was still on the runway. For some reason the previous aircraft decided to clear at the end of a 13000 runway. When the crew reached decision altitude no clearance had been given. The first officer could not get a word in edgewise to obtain the clearance. The captain disconnected the autopilot with the hopes of a late clearance but also ready for a go- around. At approximately 100 feet the Captain initiated the missed approach procedure. Clearance to land was given while the aircraft was well established in the initial go around procedure. The crew carried out the published missed approach; ATC provided vectors for a subsequent approach. The missed approach altitude was 12000 feet which triggered the Cabin Altitude Warnings again.

This area is exposed to the outside environment and can become contaminated over time. It is believed that the contamination was the cause of the control difficulties experienced by the crew in this case.

The flight crew was monitoring the fuel consumption for the number 2 engine and calculated that it was consuming 500 kg/hr more fuel than the number one engine. This was below the maximum limits of 500 kg/0.5hr consumption which the crew must consider as a fuel leak and has to shut down the engine. Further calculations by the crew determined that there was sufficient fuel on board to continue the flight to destination. At the top of descent the fuel consumption had increased to a level that the engine was not capable of normal operation and the flight crew shut down the engine (CF6-80C2B6F) and declared an emergency.

The main rotor blades struck an embankment on the dam side causing the helicopter to then roll over and come to rest on its right-hand side.  The helicopter was substantially damaged and the lone pilot received only minor injuries.  The Portugese CAA Department of Accident Investigation is investigating.  The Bell 205 was one of three helicopters engaged in water-bucketting operations to fight a nearby forest fire and the pilot had used the same irrigation dam about 20 times that day before the accident.  On the last approach the pilot reported that he saw a \Master Caution\"" warning come on during the flare; he had insufficient time however to evaluate the warning.  He tried to push the cyclic forward but found it very heavy to move and he had to apply a considerable effort to get the nose down.  At the same time he applied collective to stop the rate of descent but it was apparently ineffective as the helicopter continued to descend and landed hard.The pilot reported that the helicopter was light with about 600 pounds of fuel onboard at the time and that the approach was into a light headwind.More information to follow.""",No,Unknown,C-GFHC,HELICOPTER,BELL HELICOPTER,FRONTIER HELICOPTERS,COMMERCIAL,2251-5700 KG    (4961-12565 LBS),SKID,LIGHT,0,1,SUBSTANTIAL,FIRE FIGHTING / FIRE MANAGEMENT,

About 350 miles northwest of Goose Bay Newfoundland an impending bypass of the right engine (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4) oil filter was indicated by the illumination of a warning light in the cockpit. After the filter bypass light illuminated the captain reduced power on the affected engine until the light went out. Approximately 10 minutes later the filter bypass light came on again and the captain reduced the power to idle thrust where the light went out. The light re-illuminated approximately 20 minutes later at which time the captain followed the appropriate procedure and shut down the engine. The aircraft diverted to and landed at Goose Bay Airport Newfoundland where an inspection of the oil filter was carried out. A substantial amount of silver flakes was found in the filter; the operator decided to remove the engine and ship it to their maintenance facility for  teardown. The main gearbox was removed from the engine and disassembled. Examination revealed that approximately 40 per cent of the silver plating on the main oil pump drive gearshaft gear teeth had peeled off. The metal found in the oil filter was analysed and it was determined to be silver. However the quantity of silver plating missing from the gear teeth and found in the oil filter was not enough to clog the filter and cause a bypass condition. Further examination of the oil filter revealed a greyish-black substance engrained in the filter paper. This paper is normally a light brown or tan colour. The contaminated oil filter from this engine and an oil filter from another engine were sent for comparative analysis. The analysis revealed that the contaminated oil filter had a significantly higher-than-normal iron content and that silica was also present. Based on the laboratory analysis and the fact that no cause was found for the greyish-black substance in the oil  filter or the extremely dirty oil found in the engine the TWA Engine Review Committee decided to disassemble the entire engine. Inspection of all the main-line bearings and associated carbon seals as well as the angle gearbox did not reveal any discrepancies or abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings: 1. The right engine impending bypass oil filter warning light illuminated in flight. 2. The captain shut down the engine and landed at the nearest alternate airport. 3. Approximately 40 per cent of the silver plating on the main oil pump gearshaft gear teeth had peeled off. 4. The oil filter was contaminated with a greyish-black substance a higher-than-normal iron content and traces of silica. Causes: The oil filter was contaminated with a greyish-black substance which caused an impending bypass condition. The source of the contaminant was not determined. L'avion effectuait un vol transatlantique entre Londres en Angleterre et St. Louis aux etats-Unis. a environ 350 milles au nord-ouest de Goose Bay (Terre-Neuve) un voyant d'alarme s'est allume dans le poste de pilotage pour signaler une derivation imminente au filtre a huile du reacteur droit (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4). Quand le voyant de derivation du filtre s'est allume le commandant de bord a reduit la poussee sur le reacteur en cause jusqu'a ce que le voyant s'eteigne. Environ 10 minutes plus tard le voyant s'est allume de nouveau et le commandant a reduit la poussee au ralenti et le voyant s'est eteint. Le voyant s'est allume de nouveau environ 20 minutes plus tard. Le commandant a alors applique la procedure appropriee et a arrete le reacteur. L'avion a ete deroute sur l'aeroport de Goose Bay a Terre-Neuve ou il a atterri et une inspection du filtre a huile a ete effectuee. Une quantite importante de paillettes argentees a ete trouvee dans le filtre.  L'exploitant a decide de deposer le reacteur et de l'envoyer a son atelier d'entretien pour le demontage. Le relais d'accessoires principal a ete enleve du reacteur et demonte.

ROC / LOS,13:34:00,INCIDENT,UNKNOWN,7/8/1987 12:00:00 AM,UNKNOWN,ATLANTIC,Delta Flight 37 a Lockheed L-1011 departed London's Gatwick Airport on 08 July 1987 at 1334 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)* on a scheduled international flight to Cincinnati Ohio. Continental Flight 25 a Boeing 747-200 departed Gatwick Airport five minutes later at 1339 UTC on a scheduled international flight to Newark New Jersey. As both aircraft approached the oceanic boundary Shanwick Oceanic Control Centre assigned parallel routes separated by 60 nautical miles for the flight across the North Atlantic. Both aircraft were assigned a pressure altitude of 31000 feet (flight level 310)**. At 30 degrees west longitude Delta 37 began deviating to the south of its assigned track and closed laterally with Continental 25 (see Figure 1.1.). Delta 37's deviation continued until the aircraft crossed the assigned track of Continental 25. As Delta 37 crossed the track of Continental 25 the front half of Delta 37 passed beneath the rear fuselage of Continental 25  with less than 100 feet of vertical separation. Neither crew saw the other aircraft in time to take evasive action. The near collision occurred during the hours of daylight at 1625 UTC over the North Atlantic at lat 52o45'N long 33o12'W***. 3.1 Findings 1. The near collision resulted from an INS data input error by the Delta Flight 37 crew. 2. Delta Flight 37's crew did not follow established INS cross-checks. 3. Delta Flight 37 while at flight level 310 deviated 80 nautical miles south of its assigned track after passing 30 west. 4. Delta Flight 37 crossed the track of Continental Flight 25 which was also at flight level 310. 5. Neither aircraft crew saw the other aircraft in time to take evasive action and the angle of closure made a visual sighting unlikely. 6. The forward fuselage of Delta Flight 37 passed beneath the rear fuselage of Continental Flight 25 with less than 100 feet of vertical separation. 7. Continental Flight 25 was maintaining its assigned  track. 8. Delta 37's flight crew had limited experience in North Atlantic flying with no crew member having more than six return trips. 9. Although cross-check procedures were contained in explicit detail in the manuals used by the crew they were set out in such terms and format that a mandatory requirement to cross-check at each and every waypoint may not have been clearly conveyed to aircrew. 10. The ATC clearances received and acknowledged by both aircraft were correct and if followed would not have resulted in a loss of separation. 11. The occurrence was not reported to ATC in a timely manner by the involved flight crews in accordance with ICAO requirements. 12. Continental Flight 25 reported the occurrence to company dispatch as it approached New York. 13. The estimate for Delta Flight 37 at 40 west showing a difference of 16 minutes was not challenged by ATC nor was it required to be in the circumstances of this incident. 14. There is no direct  pilot/controller communication on transatlantic flights. 15. HF communications on transatlantic flights may be subject to significant time delays. 16. About 1.5 hours after the first occurrence the crew of Delta Flight 37 misinterpreted an ATC clearance and the aircraft was involved in a technical loss of separation with another aircraft. 17. The Delta 37 flight crew was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. 18. The Delta 37 aircraft was certified equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. 19. No evidence was found that would indicate the Delta 37 INS was malfunctioning prior to or during the flight. 3.2 Causes A navigation error resulting from an INS data input error led to the near collision. The error was not detected because the crew who were relatively inexperienced with Atlantic crossings did not perform adequate cross-checks of the INS. The company did not provide clear  direction on the INS procedures to be followed. ATC did not query the error in the crew's estimated time of arrival over the next reporting point nor was there a procedural requirement to do so at the time. ,No,Unknown,N1739D,AEROPLANE,LOCKHEED,DELTA AIR LINES,COMMERCIAL,OVER 272001 KG (599651 LBS),,HEAVY,0,3,NONE,AIR TRANSPORT,CYXU

The cabin altitude was approximately above 10 000 feet and was climbing at 1000-1500 feet/min. The crew followed the quick reference handbook (QRH) memory items after donning oxygen masks. The cabin altitude was still climbing the \""Man Mode” was selected however there were no reposts for approximately 20 seconds (the valve was not moving and was in 50% position). At this time the cabin altitude was close to 13 000 feet. The crew sent the emergency message for descend as the cabin altitude was still climbing. Just before initiating the descend the crew noticed the outflow valve movement and the cabin altitude was slowly descending (with approximately 500 feet/min). Tokyo radio was contacted on HF immediately and cancelled the MAYDAY but requested to descend to FL320 (as a precaution as the valve was closed partially - approximately 3/4). The crew were given the descend clearance about 1 minute after. By then cabin pressure was steady in descend mode with about 1000 feet/min and was going below 10 000 (still had the Cabin Alt High warning). ATC was advised that cabin pressurization was stable and requested to stay at FL360. After the cabin altitude reached below 8000 feet and the warning message was cleared from the EICAS the crew performed the QRH for \""CABIN AUTO INOP\"" followed by a phone call to MCC.

The aircraft turned 180 degree and came to a full stop with a heading of approximately 220 degrees. The flight crew thereafter taxied the aircraft to the apron.In the AIP for Greenland the following information concerning reporting of ice snow and/or slush is given:\During conditions - when runway is covered by wet ice wet snow and/or slush - the result of measurements and estimates will probably be misleading. In such situations the measurements will be reported unreliable.In SNOWTAM item H the figure \""9\""(=unreliable) followed by the measured friction value and the used instrument will be given.

The exact distance between the two aircraft at 52N/50W could not be determined.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that an air traffic controller in Madrid ACC gave American 67 the wrong latitude for 50W (52N instead of 50N) and this error was not discovered because in his position reports at 30W and 40W the co-pilot of American 67 mistakenly reported that the aircraft was proceeding to 50N/50W when in fact the aircraft was programmed to proceed to 52N/50W.

The number one engine spooled down and a high exhaust gas temperature was noted. The engine was shut down and the flight diverted to Shannon Ireland where an uneventful single-engine landing was made. The flight time on one engine was 50 minutes. Aer Lingus maintenance personnel at Shannon inspected the engine for damage but this initial inspection did not reveal any damage to the compressor blades. Suspecting a fuel pump main stage failure the fuel pump and fuel control unit (FCU) were changed. A full-power engine run-up was successfully carried out indicating normal operation of the engine and the aircraft was released for a ferry flight to Toronto Ontario. During the ferry flight while climbing through FL 313 the number one engine experienced a momentary surge; all engine parameters before and after the surge were normal. The  aircraft returned to Shannon and Air Canada personnel conducted a borescope inspection of the number one engine compressor which revealed massive high pressure compressor damage. When the engine was disassembled most of the blades in the fifth stage compressor assembly were found to have foreign object damage (FOD). Thirteen minor nicks were also found on the trailing edges of the variable inlet guide vanes. The first broken blade was found on stage seven. The heaviest damage occurred in the eighth and ninth stages where several blades were liberated and where the vanes had partially disintegrated. The nicks and tears on the blades and vanes had a circular impact pattern of approximately the diameter of a 12-point bolt; this type of bolt is used in the buildup of the engine. Inspection of the compressor revealed blades and vanes at various stages of failure progression; some of the vanes were broken off and jammed between the inner and outer shrouds. The failure  pattern indicated that compressor blade damage due to FOD had occurred sometime prior to the first engine surge. This observation was based on the presence of dull nicks and airflow-induced dirt deposits on the nicked blades. The failure of the blades and vanes showed a very clear and shiny break surface which indicated fatigue failure originating from the nicks. The original fuel pump was tested and it passed the performance test without adjustment or repair. The original FCU was installed on an engine for a test cell run and it operated within acceptable limits. The initial compressor damage was the result of FOD probably a bolt which entered the engine. This occurred at some time prior to the first engine problem and resulted in the later fatigue failure of the vanes and blades. During the flight from St. John's to London a nicked blade most likely in stage seven suffered fatigue failure and when it separated it caused the engine to spool down. On  departure for the intended ferry flight to Toronto further blade and vane failures occurred causing the engine to surge. Following this incident Air Canada introduced routine post-test compressor borescope inspections to reduce the possibility of similar failures. FINDINGS: Cause Related: 1. The initial inspection by Aer Lingus did not reveal any damage to the compressor blades. 2. The initial engine damage was a result of foreign object damage. 3. The engine spool down and compressor surge occurred when blades and vanes were liberated because of fatigue failure.

During the take-off roll from the unprepared surface (position S71 55.3 E008 17.9) for the return leg to Novo runway (Novolazarevskaya Antarctica) the aircraft contacted a snow drift and became airborne with insufficient speed to sustain flight. The aircraft stalled and contacted the surface with sufficient force to collapse the main landing gear. The aircraft came to rest on its belly sustaining substantial damage. Two passengers received minor injuries. The crew and passengers were accommodated in tents until a second Kenn Borek DC3-T arrived later in the day. More details to follow.Update: The Kenn Borek Air Wheel-ski equipped DC3-T C-GEAI had attempted a downhill off strip ski takeoff run in its landing tracks with a tailwind which proved unsuccessful due to lack of airspeed attained. A second attempt uphill into wind was carried out on the snow covered surface. C-GEAI had accelerated to 60 knots when it came into contact with a hard snow drift which caused the aircraft to yaw left and become airborne. When C-GEAI stalled and contacted the surface both main gears were sheared off resulting in major damage to propellers (Hartzell HC-B5MA-3A) engines (Pratt & Whitney PT6-67R) and airframe.Update - Feb. 13 2013 - Prior to the first landing of the season at Holtanna Glacier an over flight was conducted to assess the snow conditions and choose appropriate location. The conditions appeared satisfactory and the landing was carried out without incident. The landing roll was rougher than expected from the over flight visual. The landing site was then marked with snow filled bags to aid in subsequent landings. Drifts were noticed during this effort but true size was concealed by soft snow.During the take-off roll engine power was set to 110% torque. As the take-off roll continued the torque setting was noticed at 121% when it was reduced to 110% seconds before impact with the drift. The Pratt and Whitney PT6-6A-67R operating limitation as stated in DC3-TP67 Flight Manual for take-off torque is 100% with transient torque limited to 129% for 20 seconds duration. Upon impact with the drift the stall warning activated indicating a minimum airspeed of 56 knots was achieved. The stall warning system has a 56 Knot airspeed switch which deactivates warning below switch setting. The last airspeed call prior to impact was 50 knots 10 seconds prior to impact. The Basler DC3-TP67 Flight Manual Airspeed Limitations for Minimum Control - Air (VMCA) is 73 KCAS (calibrated airspeed) / 67 KIAS (indicated airspeed).

They had departed McMurdo Station their home base at 2025UTC on a flight to Midpoint \C\"" where they reloaded and refuelled. They then departed for AGO6 arriving there at 0154Z. The aircraft was unloaded and refuelled for the return flight to Midpoint \""C\"" for fuel then back to McMurdo. During the STOL take-off run with 20 degrees of flap extended the left ski dug into the snow covered surface causing the aircraft to swerve about 20 degrees to the left. The aircraft bounced into the air at low airspeed then the left wing dropped and the aileron hinge dug into the snow and travelled for about 100 feet. The wing then struck a skidoo and became detached from the aircraft. The Captain called for the flaps to be retracted and held full right rudder and aileron. The aircraft then travelled a further 3000 feet and came to a stop facing about 150 degrees direction from the direction of the take-off. The aircraft was substantially damaged. One crew member received minor back injuries. This flight was conducted during the hours of daylight. The flight was conducted in accordance with the existing directives in the company Operations Manual.The aircraft was certified equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. The aircraft was equipped and operating with Spring Skis. The weight and centre of gravity were within prescribed limits. There was 2700 pounds of JP-8 onboard for the return flight to Midpoint.The flight crew was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. There was no evidence that incapacitation or physiological factors affected the crew' performance. The Captain has over 16 000 hours and over 15 years experience operating in the Antarctica. Company training records reflect that the crew had all the required training.  The company founded in 1970 operates a fleet of 57 aircraft of which 35 are Twin Otters. They have extensive experience operating from both poles and on other \""off strip\"" operations. The company STOL Operations Manual requires the crew to use 20 degrees of flap for take-offs. The flaps are retracted to 10 degrees when there is a positive rate of climb on both altimeters at 400 agl then the flaps are retracted to full up at 100 knots. Turns are not permitted below 50 feet above the runway surface or below a speed of Vyse which ever occurs last.AGO 6 is at remote location 782 nm from McMurdo Station on the Eastern Antarctic Polar plateau at an elevation of 7 800 feet.

The crew advised that the deviation may have been due to wind shear.Both aircraft were operating in RVSM airspace where the minimum vertical separation allowable was 1000 feet.More to follow.Update (19 Mar 98)After landing the pilot reported that the aircraft was flying in a jetstream of approximately 115 knots from the aircraft's right aft when the a/c suddenly started sinking.  The autopilot (a/p) disconnected itself.  While manually easing the nose up the crew observed the airspeed suddenly increase into the red band - the autothrottle (a/t) was disconnected and the thrust levers were retarded to idle - the speed still increased to VMO +8 to 10 knots.  Full speed brakes were selected.  During the recovery the a/c climbed above FL340 by approximately +450 feet.At the start of the occurrence the a/p status annunciator indicated no autoland.  The crew suspected an a/p hardover due to this indication.  The LH a/p was selected after the occurrence and the flight continued to destination without further incident.Awaiting more information from the operator.,No,Unknown,G-BDXM,AEROPLANE,BOEING,BRITISH AIRWAYS,COMMERCIAL,OVER 272001 KG (599651 LBS),,HEAVY,0,4,NONE,AIR TRANSPORT,

The flight was en route from Cologne Germany with a refuelling stop at Gander Newfoundland to Havana Cuba.  The crew reported their position at 40 degrees west to the Gander Flight Service Station (FSS).  They reported at flight level (FL) 350 and requested descent to FL 310.  Gander FSS advised the crew to standby on their request for a lower altitude.  Approximately 11 minutes later CU 9343 reported level at FL 310.  During the descent CU 9343 lost separation with two other aircraft.  The other aircraft comprised an eastbound flight at FL 330 (separation was approximately one minute opposite direction) and a westbound flight at FL 310 (separation was one minute with 25 nautical miles lateral separation). CU 9343 was in radio contact with Gander FSS on 13291 kHz on the high frequency (HF) band.  Neither Gander Area Control Centre (ACC) nor Gander FSS issued a clearance to CU 9343 to descend to FL 310. Three minutes after CU 9343 requested a descent Shannon FSS issued a clearance to Pan American (Clipper) Flight 73 on the same HF frequency which read \Shannon ATC reclears you flight level 350 report leaving and reaching go ahead.\""  Both Clipper 73 and CU 9343 responded to this clearance and CU 9343 read back that they were cleared to FL 310.

There was no response to thrust lever movement and after a short period of time there was uncommanded engine shut down (GE CF6-80C2B6F). The crew was unsuccessful in restarting the engine and declared an emergency. ARFF was standing by for the uneventful landing. The #2 engine was recently installed on the aircraft after being in storage. The engine had arrived at Air Canada without an HMU. An HMU was received from the vendor and installed on the engine sometime prior to the engine being installed on the aircraft. Engine ground runs were performed and no faults were found and the aircraft was returned to service. After the occurrence maintenance found fuel leaking from the flange on the fuel line from the HMU to the fuel flow transmitter. When the line was disconnected the remnants of a yellow shipping cap were found. The cap had not been removed prior to installation and when the fuel line was connected it was squeezed between the fuel line flange and HMU. In the process of torquing down the flange bolts the cap had deformed the seal on the flange and after a few hours of operation the heat from normal engine operation deformed the softer cap and the leak developed. The cap material was soft and fuel pressure from the HMU would be sufficient to rupture the center section of the cap and allow fuel to flow. When the operator investigated the event they found that due to the curvature of the line at this location it would have been difficult to observe the shipping cap. Air Canada does not use this type of cap on their fuel lines and maintenance was not expecting to find one inside the line. Air Canada will be issuing notices to their maintenance staff to prevent this type of event from re-occurring.,No,Unknown,C-GEOU,AEROPLANE,BOEING,AIR CANADA,COMMERCIAL,27001-272000 KG (59526-599650 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,HEAVY,1999,2,NONE,AIR TRANSPORT,CYYZ

The controller completed a trial probe to determine if separation would be maintained between the aircraft. The controller then cleared AMX0005 to FL390 at which time separation between the aircraft eroded to approximately 7 minutes longitudinally where 10 minutes longitudinal or 1000 feet vertical is required. By the time the error was discovered required separation had been regained.The method the controller used for the trial probe is for use in a radar controlled environment by flight planners prior to the aircraft entering oceanic airspace. Included in this method is a sliding Mach scale which is used when the leading aircraft is faster thus assuring separation as both aircraft progress. This allows the aircraft to enter oceanic airspace without the required 10 minute longitudinal separation.

It was reported that the power-receptacle of oven number three exhibited evidence of scorching and arcing due to defective contact pins; the nature of the defect was not reported. No other part of the over showed scorching or arcing of any kind.UPDATE 20 Dec 02: Upon further investigation of the electronic oven control system it was revealed that one TRIAC (out of 9) was defective but did not show any signs of damage or burnt markings (TRIAC #44 on Power Switch Assembly; P/N 5398003A). This TRIAC is part of the system which controls the alternating current (AC) fan-motor and heating. It is probable that the failure of TRIAC #44 and consequently the failure of one phase of the AC-fan-motor could result in higher electric current.

MONTREAL ACC CALLED THE MONCTON OSS AND ADVISED THEM THAT DAL31 WAS NOW 59N/60W DIRECT TAFFY.  THIS ROUTING RESULTED IN DAL31 CONVERGING WITH AAL67 TRACK AFTER ENTERING MONCTON ACC AIRSPACE ABOUT 6 MINUTES AFTER TURNING SOUTH FROM POSITION 59N/60W.THE MONCTON OSS PRINTED OUT A DATA STRIP FOR DAL31.  THIS STRIP WENT TO THE DATA BOARD FOR THE APPLICABLE SECTOR.

The pilot was unable to restart the engine so the engine was shut down. Maintenance personnel determined that the high-pressure fuel pump had failed; the HP fuel pump and the fuel control unit were replaced. Engineering Memorandum No. 3-6273-00 from Air Canada advises that the fuel pump failed as a result of looseness developing in the clamp assembly which secures the pump to the gear box. This caused excessive drive shaft spline wear. A fleet-wide campaign was initiated for inspection of all B747 and B767 aircraft engines having similar fuel pumps. Any pumps found loose were to be scheduled for removal and corrective action as required. Le moteur numero un s'est eteint en vol en croisiere. Le pilote n'a pu le redemarrer et il en a coupe l'allumage. Le personnel du service de maintenance a determine que la pompe a carburant haute pression est tombee en panne. La pompe en question et le regulateur de carburant ont ete remplaces. D'apres la Note de service technique numero 3-6273-00 d'Air Canada la pompe a carburant est tombee en panne parce que le collet de fixation de la pompe au boitier d'engrenages s'etait desserre. Il s'en est suivi une usure excessive de l'arbre d'entrainement cannele. Une campagne a l'echelle de la flotte a ete lancee pour que tous les reacteurs des B747 et des B767 equipes de pompes a carburant similaires soient inspectes.

ROC / LOS,10:30:00,INCIDENT,UNKNOWN,3/19/1985 12:00:00 AM,UNKNOWN,ATLANTIC,"A DC-10 and an IL62 westbound across the North Atlantic experienced a loss of separation when the IL62 was cleared by Gander Oceanic Control to climb through the altitude of the DC-10 (FL330). An invalid 20-degree west estimate on the DC-10 was sent from Shanwick Oceanic Control. The data strip used by the Gander controller who issued the climb clearance was based on this invalid time. The primary protection for discovering this type of error is the actual 20-degree west position report. This report on the DC-10 was placed in an \actioned\"" basket without being actioned. The Unit Operations Manual procedure of coordinating climb clearances within 20 minutes of the common boundary (Shanwick/Gander) was not followed. The two aircraft had approximately one minute of longitudinal separation when the IL62 climbed through FL350. The original error in Shanwick was made when the automatic data transfer system was unserviceable and manual inputs were being made. The actual  20-degree west position report was stuck to the back of an actioned report and was placed in an \""actioned\"" basket. The controller who issued the climb clearance was using a 10-minute coordination instead of the 20-minute standard. FINDINGS: Cause Related: 1. The proposed 20-degree west time for the DC-10 which was sent from Shanwick to Gander was in error. 2. The actual 20-degree west position report from the DC-10 was not actioned. 3. The 20-minute coordination standard which is outlined in the Unit Operations Manual was not followed. 4. The two aircraft had approximately one minute of longitudinal separation when the IL62 climbed through FL350. Other: -Nil- L'espacement reglementaire entre le DC-10 et l'IL62 en direction ouest sur l'Atlantique nord n'a pas ete respecte lorsque le controle oceanique de Gander a autorise l'IL62 a monter au-dessus de l'altitude du DC-10 (FL330). Une erreur dans l'heure prevue d'arrivee du DC-10 au meridien 20deg ouest a ete transmise par le controle oceanique de Shanwick. La fiche de vol utilisee par le controleur de Gander qui a accorde l'autorisation de monter etait fondee sur cette heure prevue erronee. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective au meridien 20deg ouest est la principale methode de deceler une erreur du genre. Le compte rendu initial avait ete place par erreur dans la panier \""mesures prises\"". Les consignes etablies dans le manuel d'exploitation de l'unite precisent que la coordination des montees doit avoir lieu dans les 20 minutes de longitude qui precedent l'arrivee a la limite Shanwick/Gander mais elles n'ont pas ete suivies. Lorsque l'IL62 a traverse le FL350 en montee  leur espacement longitudinal n'etait que d'environ une minute. L'erreur initiale commise a Shanwick s'est produite lorsque le systeme de transfert automatique des donnees est tombe en panne et que les entrees ont du etre faites a la main. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective au meridien 20deg ouest a ete depose dans le panier \""mesures prises\"" parce qu'il s'etait colle a l'arriere d'un compte rendu deja traite. Le controleur qui a accorde l'autorisation de monter avait coordonne l'espacement apres 10 minutes de longitude au lieu des 20 minutes reglementaires. CONCLUSIONS Faits etablis se rapportant aux causes: 1. L'heure prevue d'arrivee du DC-10 au meridien 20deg W transmise a Gander par Shanwick etait erronee. 2. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective du DC-10 au meridien 20deg ouest n'a pas ete traite. 3. La norme de coordination etablie a 20 minutes de longitude prescrite dans le manuel d'exploitation de l'unite n'a pas ete respectee. 4. Les deux aeronefs avaient un  espacement logitudinal d'environ une minute lorsque l'IL62 a traverse le FL350 en montee.

NO TRACE OF THE A/C WAS FOUND DESPITE AN INTENSIVE SEARCH MOUNTED BY BARBADOS. THE A/C HAD DEPARTED FROM TIMEHRI AIRPORT IN GUYANA ON A VFR FLIGHT PLAN TO ANTIGUA ENROUTE TO CANADA. CONSIDERABLE CARGO WAS CARRIED INCLUDING TWO SPARE ENGINES ONE EXTRA PROPELLER AND OTHER SPARE PARTS. THE ONLY OVERWATER SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT ON BOARD WAS FOUR LIFE JACKETS. WITNESSES SAW THE A/C BEING LOADED AND SAW THE PILOTS AND PASSENGER EMBARK. A NUMBER OF RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE FLIGHT THE FIRST BEING RECEIVED IN GUYANA AT 1835Z AND THE BALANCE BY PILOTS OF OTHER A/C. THE TRANSMISSION TO GUYANA INDICATED SIMPLY THAT ALL WAS WELL. THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSMISSIONS  ADVISED OF THE ENGINE FAILURE THE OVERHEATING OF THE OTHER ENGINE THE ESTIMATED POSITION AND THE INTENTION TO DIVERT TO BARBADOS AND GAVE THE ALTITUDE AS 1500 FT. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT ENGINE POWER SETTINGS AND FINALLY A TRANSMISSION AT 1939Z SAYING THEY WERE DOWN TO 50 FT. THE PILOT OF ANOTHER A/C REPORTED THAT HE WAS IN THE VICINITY AT 14000 FT AND DESCRIBED THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AS GOOD WITH LIGHT CUMULUS CLOUDS. HE SAID THE WATER COULD BE SEEN AT ALL TIMES. HE INDICATED HE HAD CALLED THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM BARBADOS AND THAT THE PILOT OF THE CARIBOU HAD REPLIED IMMEDIATELY.

HE MADE HIS APPROACH TO THE WEST AND REALIZED THAT THE SETTING SUN WAS REDUCING HIS FORWARD VISIBILITY. HE DECIDED TO LAND ABOUT 700-1000 FEET LONG TO AVOID AN UNDERSHOOT KNOWING THAT HE STILL HAD 2300 FEET TO GO. THE ROLL OUT WAS DESCRIBED AS NORMAL AND THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED HOWEVER WITH 1000 FEET OF RUNWAY REMAINING THE PILOT REALIZED THAT HE WAS GOING TOO FAST.
