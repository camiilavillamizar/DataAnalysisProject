110090,"Cyclone 180, a private, amateur-built aircraft, took off from the Gouin reservoir towards Lake Matambin. According to a witness, the ceiling was unlimited and visibility was over 15 kilometres at the time of takeoff. The weather deteriorated en route with mist enveloping the mountaintops. Witnesses who were about 400 metres from the accident site heard and then observed the aircraft flying over them at about 30 feet above the treetops before losing sight of it in the mist. A few seconds later, the seaplane struck trees at the top of a mountain. Both occupants died in the accident."
99229,"The Bel-Air pilot was conducting an approach on a snowy and elevated surface. On short final, the pilot decided to make a climb after realizing that he was lower than the runway. During the maneuver, the ski-equipped aircraft stalled at approximately 25 agl. The aircraft struck the ground on the right side. The pilot and passenger suffered minor facial injuries. The aircraft was not equipped with harnesses. The aircraft was heavily damaged."
97566,the kitfox iv suffered an engine failure (rotax 582) in cruise flight. the pilot made an emergency landing in a plowed field. the aircraft flipped over during the landing roll. the pilot estimates there was about a gallon of fuel in each wing.
97551,"During the takeoff run, the C-172 pilot judged that there was not enough runway left to take off and decided to abort the takeoff. The aircraft left the runway and hit a ditch before coming to a stop 300 feet away."
97065,"At takeoff at a height of about 20 feet, a downwind blew the b8n to the ground. The gyrocopter hit the ground hard. The aircraft suffered significant damage."
96733,"The instructor pilot was demonstrating low-altitude steep turns in the float-equipped C-180. During a turn, the flap control lever, which was incorrectly engaged in the 30° position, unexpectedly moved back to the 20° position. The aircraft suddenly lost altitude, and the left float and tail struck trees. The pilot landed without further incident."
94169,"When the C-208 amphibious aircraft landed, its landing gear was down. The aircraft flipped over after hitting the water. The aircraft came to rest on its back, held on the surface of the river by its floats. More information to follow."
93868,"Thirteen minutes after takeoff, the pilot of the SA 226-TC informed the controller that he wanted to return to Dorval because of a problem with the hydraulic system. Seven minutes later, the pilot decided to land at Mirabel after reporting a fire in the left engine. The aircraft crashed on runway 24 before coming to rest on its back in a ditch at the edge of the runway. All eleven occupants died in the accident."
93155,"During a solo training flight, the student pilot and co-owner of the Aeronca was practicing precautionary landings in a field and decided to land. During the touchdown and initial landing roll, he applied the heel brakes too abruptly and the Aeronca nosedived and ended up almost upside down. There is damage to the propeller, the engine, the engine cowling, the left wing and the canvas."
92944,"The Cessna 172 was departing Runway 14 with a right crosswind. During the takeoff roll, a gust of wind lifted the right wing and the aircraft lifted off prematurely at approximately 40 mph. The pilot then applied the steering wheel to the right to straighten the wings and applied full left rudder to maintain the runway heading. When the wind speed decreased, the aircraft lost altitude and landed on the runway. Since the pilot had not yet released the left rudder pedal, the aircraft veered toward the north side of the runway where it overturned after hitting a snow bank. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The pilot was not injured in the accident. The wind was 215? magnetic at 15 knots."
92655,"The Murphy Rebel took off from Gatineau Airport. At an altitude of about 100 feet, the engine stopped. The pilot made a forced landing and brought the aircraft to a stop in a field 200 feet from the runway threshold. The Honda engine had only accumulated 15 hours of operation."
92511,"The ATR 42 landed on Runway 27 at Sept-Iles and then taxied to the parking area where it was to stop at Gate #1. Three signallers were helping the pilot manoeuvre. One was in front of the aircraft while the other two were at the wingtips. Near the terminal, the aircraft was to turn left. According to the crew members, the pilot applied the brakes after judging that the space between the right wingtip and the building was tight. He released the brakes and then moved forward after the signaller near the terminal and the right wing indicated that the wing was passing. The aileron tip struck the terminal and sustained significant damage. The signallers stated that they signalled to the pilots to stop before the collision occurred but that the pilots were not looking at them."
92292,"The Piper PA-31 Navajo was on a charter flight from Iqaluit to Pangnirtung with one passenger on board. Upon landing, the crew saw the three green landing gear lights and visually confirmed the gear position using mirrors. Upon landing, just before applying the brakes, the nose gear collapsed. The crew reported a normal landing and the aircraft came to rest in the centre of the runway. The weather at the time of the incident was: wind calm, visibility 15 miles, ceiling 21,000 feet scattered. Damage was reported to be limited to the nose gear and both propellers. No injuries. Runway conditions at the time of the incident were 40% bare and frozen, with 60% snow puddles one-half to one inch thick. Other damage is limited to some scratches on the nose of the device. An update will follow."
92173,A mid-air collision occurred between a C-172 and a C-150 while the aircraft were on final for Runway 29 in Mascouche. The occupants of each of the two aircraft both suffered fatal injuries.
91738,"The aircraft, a PA-12, coming from Selbaye Mine and bound for Amos, had engine misfires while cruising. The pilot applied the ailerons a few times to swing the wings from left to right and the engine regained power. The pilot suspected that the fuel was contaminated by water. The aircraft regained about 150 feet of altitude but further engine misfires occurred. The engine continued at idle speed; the power was insufficient to maintain altitude and the pilot had to make an emergency landing in a swamp. The pilot suffered minor injuries to his right wrist while the passenger escaped unharmed. The aircraft suffered significant damage."
91622,"During the final approach, the Zenair CH-701's engine (Rotax 583) stopped when the pilot reduced the throttle. The aircraft landed approximately 200 feet short of the threshold of Runway 14. The nose wheel was torn off and the belly of the aircraft was heavily damaged. The pilot escaped unharmed. The aircraft's owner suspects a malfunction of the engine's fuel pump."
91608,"during landing roll on runway 07 the nose wheel of the seneca collapsed. the pilot did not report any anomalies before the gear failure. the cause has not been established. information to follow. 13 nov 97: after examining the nose gear the operator suspects excessive wear of the \nose gear down lock linkage\"" part no 95724-00."""
91544,The Cessna 152 with two occupants on board was pulling up to the Turtle Lake runway when the right wing struck a tree and the aircraft fell to the ground nose down. Preliminary information received indicates that the aircraft was pulling up into a downwind position with the flaps up and the engine developing power. The pilot had little experience and all indications are that the aircraft had passed the runway threshold when the downwind pull-up without flaps was initiated. The aircraft had not climbed sufficiently to avoid impact with the trees and then crashing into the ground.
91476,"During the initial climb, the pilot of the Cessna 185 on fleets noticed a loss of power and chose to land straight ahead since he did not have enough altitude to return to the lake. The aircraft landed in the trees and sustained significant damage. SAR was called to intervene. The pilot was unharmed. The weather conditions were VFR and the aircraft had a weight and balance within the manufacturer's limits. The fuel tanks were 3/4 full. The engine has 331 hours. The engine will be sent to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada laboratory for analysis. Information to follow."
91191,a97: a97q0183: the float-equipped aztec crashed shortly after takeoff from squaw lake. during the crash the plane struck electrical wires and burst into flames. the pilot survived the crash but both passengers died.
91023,"While on short final, the pilot of the Cessna 180 made a climb. After making a left turn, the aircraft made a right turn and crashed into the side of a hill. The aircraft caught fire shortly after impact."
90920,"Following a local night flight, the pilot of the Cessna 150 did not flare the aircraft when landing. The aircraft landed abruptly, the nose landing gear broke and the aircraft ended up on its nose. The approach to the runway was at 70 mph and with 30 degrees of flaps. It appears that the strobe light blinded the pilot as he flared the aircraft for landing. There were no injuries. The engine mount, propeller and nose landing gear were damaged. The pilot had not flown at night since May 1997."
90616,"The pilot and two passengers boarded a Cessna 172K on floats and took off from Lake Aiguillon for a fishing trip to Peribonka. During takeoff, according to the pilot, the temperature and humidity were high. In addition, the winds were crosswinds during takeoff. During the initial climb, the aircraft was unable to climb sufficiently and one of the floats hit the rocks of a peninsula located in the flight path. The aircraft came to a stop after the peninsula. The floats and float attachments were heavily damaged. No one was injured. According to the pilot, the weight and balance of the aircraft were within the permitted limits."
90229,the pilot was conducting a test and demonstration flight of the rotorcraft helicopter. in flight smoke began to billow from the engine compartment. the pilot immediately initiated an approach to make an emergency landing. at approximately 50 feet above ground level the engine (rotax 912) seized and shut down. the pilot landed the aircraft hard and the helicopter skidded to a halt. both occupants were unharmed. the aircraft then caught fire. the pilot discovered the oil filter on the ground and outside the aircraft. it was determined that the filter had unscrewed from the engine and that the threads on the filter rod holding it to the engine had been forced. the owner will submit an sdr to transport canada to have clips added to prevent the filter from unscrewing in flight.
90227,"The pilot alone on board the Tierra II ultralight was landing on a private runway with a tailwind. During taxiing, the pilot lost directional control of the aircraft, which spun. He applied the throttle again and, as the distance was insufficient, the aircraft crashed into the water. The pilot died."
89996,"A Cessna 172 aircraft on floats with a pilot and a passenger on board was taxiing on a lake to take up position near a river mouth. When the pilot turned around to take up position, the strong crosswind lifted the aircraft and caused it to tip over onto its nose. The aircraft remained suspended by the floats. The two occupants evacuated the cabin quickly during the rotation and swam back to shore. After a long walk, they were able to meet other people who took charge of them."
89799,"The ultralight aircraft, which was being advanced on skis, had just taken off in a westerly direction from the frozen surface of Lake St. Jean for a training flight under visual flight conditions. The aircraft was sighted shortly after takeoff and, according to the testimonies collected, was heading west. At approximately 2:00 p.m., an emergency signal emitted by a distress radio beacon was picked up by the Sarsat satellite. The central search and rescue unit dispatched a helicopter from the Bagotville base to the scene of the accident. The aircraft was spotted on the frozen surface of Lake St. Jean where it had crashed. The two occupants of the aircraft had suffered fatal injuries. The pilot who owned the aircraft held a student pilot permit for an ultralight aircraft that had been issued to him in July 1996. According to the privileges of a student pilot permit (airplane), any flight must be authorized by an instructor. There is no indication that the pilot was authorized for the flight undertaken. His companion had a private pilot license for a conventional aircraft and acted as pilot-in-command and instructor during the flight. He was not qualified to provide flight instruction on ultralight aircraft according to the regulations in force. The aircraft was a CADI model, an advanced type ultralight. The owner had assembled the aircraft himself over a period of approximately fourteen months. The aircraft was certified as equipped and maintained in accordance with existing aviation regulations and approved procedures. The weight and balance were within prescribed limits. The manufacturer had approved the spins and stalls in accordance with the advanced ultra-light aeroplane design standards. Examination of the aircraft at the accident site determined that there was no airframe failure or system malfunction before or during the flight. Inspection of the propeller blades suggests that the engine was operating at full power at the time of impact with the ground. The short wreckage trail and evidence of high vertical forces indicate that the aircraft crashed in a stall or spin. As a result of the impact forces, both occupants were killed. the aircraft was equipped with seat belts and both occupants were wearing their seat belts. the weather conditions were suitable for visual flight the wind was calm and visibility was unlimited. at this location and time of year the lake is covered with ice and snow. when flying over the uniform white surface of the frozen lake it is difficult to accurately assess the height of the aircraft above the surface of the frozen lake during the exercise. the aircraft stalled at an altitude from which recovery from the stall or spin was impossible. there is no indication that the pilot's performance was compromised by any incapacity of physiological or psychological factors."
89688,"The student pilot aboard a Cessna 152 was performing solo touch-and-gos on Runway 06. After the third touch-and-go, the pilot applied power and the aircraft drifted to the right. The student pilot was unable to maintain directional control of the Cessna, which ended up off the runway and overturning. The runway is 150 feet wide and the winds were calm. The student pilot had nearly 40 hours of dual flight time and only 2 hours of solo flight time. No anomalies were detected on the aircraft."
89609,"The pilot of the Piper PA-28 made a descent from 1,200 agl to 700 agl. When the power was restored, the engine misfired. The pilot immediately selected carburetor reheat. The engine regained power, but it was too late. The pilot was forced to land the aircraft in a field. The aircraft suffered significant damage to the wings and nose gear."
89313,"On short final for runway 27, the Beech 23 was blown to the left by a gust of wind. The aircraft landed south of the runway in the snow. The wind was from 330 degrees at 10 knots - 15 knots. All four occupants were unharmed. The aircraft sustained significant damage."
89271,"The pilot of the AS350D was performing a patrol of the railway line. The pilot landed on the track parallel to the rail and with the right end of the main rotor under a telephone wire. During takeoff, a blade collided with the telephone wire. The pilot landed without further problems and no occupants were injured. The weather conditions were Cavok."
89085,"The pilot of the Cessna 172N and his three passengers were flying over the municipality of La Baie at an altitude of 1,300 feet when the engine misfired. The pilot landed the aircraft in the Alcan parking lot but the left wing struck a light pole during deceleration on the ground. It appears that one of the fuel lines was clogged with ice. The outside temperature was -28 degrees at the time of the occurrence."
88575,"The home-built Cyclone 180 had landed on Lake Kavisilivulik to drop off the pilot's father, who had a camp there. The aircraft's engine was still running since the pilot had been having problems with his starter for some time. The pilot and a young man helped the other passenger unload the equipment on the left side of the aircraft. When boarding, the pilot asked the young man to go around the aircraft in order to board on the right side. The young man went around the aircraft toward the front and was struck by the propeller. He was pronounced dead a short time later at the Kuujjuaq hospital. The police visited the scene."
88272,"The Cessna 140 aircraft landed on the 50-foot-wide asphalt runway. While taxiing, the pilot lost directional control of the aircraft. The Cessna with tailwheel came to rest inverted on the runway. Crosswinds were blowing at 10 knots. The two occupants were not injured."
88266,"The pilot of the Avid Flyer on Floats (amateur-built) was making an approach into a bay. The water conditions were glassy. As it flared near the surface, the aircraft stalled and the right wing hit the water. The aircraft remained on its floats but the wing was heavily damaged. The pilot was not injured."
87470,"The ultralight professional pilot was at the controls of the Cosmos company Chronos. At the time of takeoff from the shimmering surface of the Chambly basin, the aircraft on a float initiated a porpoising movement that the pilot was unable to counter. The aircraft tipped over and the two occupants of the aircraft ended up in the water. The pilot stated that it is also possible that one of the floats hit a piece of wood. The float would then have filled up and the aircraft would have subsequently tipped over."
87406,At about 1400 feet altitude in cruise descent the Zenair's aero engine suddenly stopped. The aircraft was then above the houses and the forest; the pilot was unable to reach the surrounding fields and stalled the aircraft on the top of the trees. The fall to the ground caused significant damage to the aircraft. The reason for the failure is not yet known. Information to follow.
87259,The pilot of the RC-3 Seebee took off from the Lac Figuery runway for a short flight with the intention of landing on the lake to refuel the aircraft. The amphibious aircraft flipped over during the landing and came to rest on its back. The pilot stated that he had forgotten to retract the landing gear before landing on the lake. The aircraft sustained significant damage and the pilot escaped unharmed from the accident.
86865,the pilot and his passenger were taking off from a private runway. as the takeoff roll seemed longer than usual the pilot aborted the takeoff. during deceleration the nose wheel sank into soft sand and the aircraft rolled over. the pilot was familiar with this private runway. the runway is 30 feet wide. the beginning is grass followed by hard sand but which becomes soft later. at the end of the runway is a river. according to the pilot there was no anomaly with the aircraft. the weight and balance were within the permitted limits. the winds were non-existent. the emergency locator transmitter went off but the pilot forgot to turn it off. as there was no way to communicate with the pilot a search and rescue aircraft went to the scene to confirm the condition of the occupants. both were unharmed.
86861,"the pilot and his passenger in the cessna 172l took off from geralton ontario for mascouche quebec on a vfr flight plan. they were returning from a cross-country flight across canada. enroute the pilot made several touch-and-go stops and at val-d'or calculated that the c-172 still had enough fuel to reach its destination. enroute at 5,500 feet over a mountainous region communications became difficult and navigation aids unreliable. about 65 minutes north of mirabel the pilot entered an emergency code when he encountered adverse weather conditions and became unsure of his position. shortly after he climbed to 10,000 feet and called control with a distress signal stating that he had about 30 minutes of fuel remaining. Radar guidance was given to reach nearby airports but without success. Nine (9) minutes later, the aircraft disappeared from the radar screens 51 minutes from Mirabel and at 6,500 feet. An airliner flying over the area informed the control centre that the pilot mentioned that the aircraft's engine had stopped and, since he was unable to reach the Macaza runway, he was making a precautionary landing. He landed the aircraft in a wooded area near a stream. On the ground, the pilot activated the emergency locator transmitter. A search and rescue aircraft recovered the two occupants 90 minutes later. They were treated at the hospital for minor injuries. The pilot had checked the weather before his departure. He had 120 hours of total flight experience and no instrument flight rating. He mentioned that the device operated normally until the fuel ran out."
86828,"On June 26, 1996, the pilot and a passenger took off from Lake Maskinonge in his PA-18 on floats for a pleasure flight to Lac du Docteur. On final approach to land on the lake, the pilot flared at about 15 feet above the water surface. Shortly afterward, the aircraft nose-dived, the right float touched the water and the aircraft then came to rest on its back, held on the surface by the floats. The passenger who was sitting in the rear seat managed to exit the aircraft while the pilot remained inside the cabin. Several attempts to remove the pilot from the aircraft were unsuccessful and he died. The occurrence occurred during daylight hours at approximately 1800 local time. The pilot had the necessary licence and qualifications for the flight and in accordance with the regulations in force. the training he had received met transport canada requirements. a review of the available documents revealed that the pilot had approximately 375 hours of flight time. he was very familiar with this lake and its environment. when he landed, the winds were blowing in the axis of the lake at approximately 10 knots. the aircraft was certified as equipped and maintained in accordance with the regulations in force and approved procedures. he had accumulated 9.3 hours of flight time since the last inspection. the weight and balance of the aircraft were within the prescribed limits. the aircraft was equipped with seat belts as recommended but was not equipped with shoulder harnesses. however, transport canada regulations do not require this category of aircraft to be equipped with shoulder harnesses. both occupants had fastened their seat belts during the flight. About an hour earlier, another aircraft that was part of the same expedition had landed on the lake. The occupants who were waiting for the PA-18 to arrive observed its approach, which seemed normal to them. Witnesses mentioned that during the flare at about 15 feet above the water, the aircraft pitched up slightly before nose-diving. The right float then hit the water and the aircraft overturned. The nose-down attitude is consistent with a loss of control following a stall. Examination of the wreckage revealed no structural failure prior to impact. The damage and twisting sustained by the propeller blades indicate that the engine was providing very little power at impact, which is normal during the final phase of water landing. Three of the four wing attachment points were fractured in overload following the impact. In addition, the ceiling structure was considerably deformed due to the impact and obstructed the evacuation of the aircraft's occupants. The flight controls showed no indication of failure before the impact. The aircraft's seats were attached to the floor and did not undergo any deformation. The seat belts were functioning normally. There was no indication that an incapacity or physiological factors could have disrupted the pilot's abilities. The witnesses and the passenger tried in vain to rescue the pilot, but since the cockpit had been deformed during the impact and the pilot had remained trapped inside, their attempts were unsuccessful. It was therefore established that during the water landing, the aircraft stalled at an altitude insufficient to allow the pilot to straighten the aircraft. This information was sent to the designated coroner and the victim's next of kin on September 9, 1996."
86767,a95q0091: the aircraft a hughes 500c was on approach to a temporary helipad on the side of a mountain. after a pass at 200 feet above the landing point the pilot decided to fly the downwind approach since it was the only option. on short final the aircraft yawed to the right while hovering at a height of 30 to 40 feet. the pilot attempted to correct but the aircraft sank. the pilot used collective to absorb the impact with the ground. the aircraft came to rest on its left side in a nose-down attitude. no one was injured. during the approach the wind was blowing at a speed of 10 knots with gusts to 15 knots.translation:a96q0091: the helicopter a hughes 369 was conducting an approach to a temporary helipad on the side of a mountain.  after overflying the helipad at an altitude of 200' obove the pad the pilot determined that his only option was to conduct a downwind approach to the site.  on short final and while in a 30 to 40' hover the helicopter yawed to the right.  the pilot was unable to control the yaw and the helicopter struck the ground.  the pilot was able to cushion the landing by raising collective. the helicopter came to rest on its left side.  there were no injuries.at the time of the approach the wind was 10 knots with gusts to 15.
86592,"The pilot of the amateur-built Rebel aircraft on fleets intended to practice landings and takeoffs on Lake St. Pierre. This was his first flight with this aircraft on fleets. When it touched down in the water, the pilot lost control of the aircraft, which inverted into the water. The pilot was unharmed."
86587,The Piper PA 31 with four people on board had taken off from Kangiqsujuaq at 1048L on May 30. It was on a VFR flight plan to the Craters of New Quebec. It intended to land at Kuujjuaq. The aircraft never reached its destination and was reported missing. No emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was received. Search and rescue located the aircraft around 1900 hours on May 31. There were no survivors. Investigators were dispatched to the scene.
86536,the pilot sole person onboard the bell 206b was landing between a power line and a line of trees. guy wires further restricted the size of the landing area and the winds were blowing at 20 to 25 knots towards the wooded area. the helicopter drifted and while maneuvering to a better landing area the main rotor struck a tree with a diameter of 6 to 7 inches. the pilot landed the aircraft immediately and without further incident. the main rotor sustained significant damage and an inspection was made and components replaced in accordance with the manufacturer's procedures. the pilot landed immediately with no further incident. the main rotor was substantially damaged and an inspection of the drive train resulted in the replacement of certain components in accordance with the manufacturer's procedures.
86238,"The lone pilot of his Beaver ultralight took off at approximately 07:00 EDT from Louiseville Airport, Quebec, for a local pleasure flight. Two people driving east on Highway 40 saw the ultralight flying over them at an altitude of approximately 400 feet above ground level. They observed the ultralight flying parallel to the road as it made a tight left turn to line up on final with Runway 27. The aircraft then pitched up sharply and nose-dived before rolling over onto its back, touching down on the surface of a pond. The two people in the vehicle headed to the crash site to rescue the occupant. The aircraft was discovered overturned and submerged in a pond located at the start of runway 27. A person tried to reach the wreckage in the water but was unsuccessful given the depth of the water at that location. Rescue services were dispatched to the other side of the pond and the pilot was found to be dead. The pilot had purchased the aircraft a few weeks earlier from a private individual. He had transported it to Louiseville airport and then assembled it with a friend. He held a private pilot's license on conventional aircraft and had approximately 720 hours of flight experience. He had no experience flying ultralights and was making his first flight on this type of aircraft. His last medical examination was on 30 August 1995 and was valid until 1 September 1997. The toxicological examination did not reveal the presence of alcohol or other toxic substances. There was no indication that incapacity or physiological or psychological factors could have affected the pilot's abilities. An examination of the wreckage determined that the ultralight had no defects that could have contributed to the accident. The weight and balance of the ultralight were within the prescribed limits. An examination of the propeller determined that the aircraft's engine was shut down at the time of impact. Rotax 550 engines are prone to sudden shutdowns when a rapid reduction in engine speed is induced. On this type of ultralight, when a sudden engine shutdown occurs, the aircraft tends to pitch up. If the pilot does not react immediately to the pronounced pitch-up of the ultralight by pushing down on the controls, the aircraft tends to stall fairly quickly. The damage observed to the ultralight is indicative of a stall. Given the low height of the aircraft, the pilot was unable to recover from the stall. This information was sent to the coroner and the victim's next of kin on 18 June 1996."
85756,"the pilot and his student were practicing autorotations with their as-350d helicopter when they had a hard landing. according to the pilot, the winds were blowing from the right at 45 degrees and were blowing from 20 to 25 knots with gusts to 40 knots. during the impact sequence, the main rotor hit the ground when the aircraft ended up on the tips of its skids with a 40-degree nose-down attitude. the skids and the nose of the aircraft were damaged. the aircraft came to rest on its landing gear. additional information to follow. according to the instructor the wind was blowing from 45 degrees to the right of the helicopter at 20 to 25 knots with gusts up to 40 knots.on the occurrence sequence the main rotor touched the ground when the helicopter ended up on the toes of the skids with a nose down attitude of 40 degrees.  the skids and nose section of the helicopter were damaged.  the helicopter came to rest upright on its skids."
84974,"Shortly after the AS350-BA helicopter landed, one of the passengers was hit by the main rotor while exiting the aircraft. He was pronounced dead at the hospital."
84602,"The pilot of the Cessna 150 was scheduled to fly a circuit on Runway 28 as part of his first solo flight. The wind was blowing from 280 degrees magnetic at a speed of 7 to 10 km. On final, the pilot set the flaps to 30 degrees. Upon touching down, the aircraft bounced and the pilot applied some power. The aircraft pitched up and began to turn left even though the pilot was applying right rudder pedals. The aircraft stalled and came to rest at the edge of the runway. Both wings were damaged, but the pilot was uninjured. The pilot had accumulated a total of 35 hours of dual flight time prior to the occurrence."
84476,The pilot of the Cessna 402 pulled up on an approach to runway 02 at Wabush Airport. The controller cleared the aircraft for a second approach. He then lost radio contact with the pilot at 1905 ADT. The aircraft was located the next day at approximately 0730 local time by SAR. All five occupants sustained minor injuries.
84333,"During landing, the pilot was unable to control the PA18-250 (Supercub) on the float, which always seemed to want to head to the right. The aircraft crashed near the shore of the lake. The aircraft suffered significant damage. The pilot stated that during the week preceding the event, he had gone to Bel-Air Aviation to make repairs to the aircraft's engine. On site, he was advised to repaint the aircraft's struts. However, it would appear that the struts were not returned to their original location since the aircraft always pulled to the right in flight, which had never been the case before this inspection of the struts. Several flight tests were carried out before the aircraft demonstrated acceptable flight qualities. Final adjustments were to be made on the next visit to the repair shop. On final for Gody Lake the pilot had a speed of 80 mph and 20 degrees of flap. When the aircraft's speed decreased he was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft which crashed into the lake."
84064,"During the taxi, the pilot inadvertently pulled the Cessna 182RG's landing gear lever instead of the throttle. The nose wheel retracted and the left landing gear partially retracted. The aircraft came to rest on the runway, resting on its nose and left wingtip. The pilot escaped unharmed."
83793,"The c185 floatplane stalled during a steep turn to the base leg for touch-and-go landings on the lake. The pilot was distracted while making the turn for the base-final leg when he saw an aircraft on final. He inadvertently let his aircraft speed drop and it stalled. The pilot was unable to regain control of the aircraft before hitting the trees. During the base leg, winds of 8-10 knots were coming from behind the aircraft. The base-final leg was below 500 feet agl. The pilot was operating without a valid license as his medical had expired."
83718,"During the water landing, the pilot of the Cessna 206 lost control of the aircraft. Wind gusts from the left at 15 to 20 knots lifted the left wing shortly after the water hit. The right float sank and the aircraft capsized. No injuries."
83536,"On takeoff from Lake Pelan with a headwind, the aircraft climbed onto the step but was unable to take off from the surface of the lake. The pilot cut the throttle too late and the seaplane ended up in the trees. The aircraft suffered damage to the right float and the left wing."
83435,"The student pilot had been practicing touch-and-go for 50 minutes. The winds were calm. On final approach, the aircraft deviated from the runway centerline and the pilot was unable to correct. He applied the throttle but the aircraft deviated further and further to the left. The pilot was unable to control the aircraft and climb sufficiently to clear the obstacles ahead. He landed the aircraft in a wooded area approximately 2,000 feet to the left of Runway 29. The student pilot had a total of 25 hours of flight time, including 5 hours solo. He had been cleared for the flight. The asphalt runway is 3,000 feet by 75 feet. An inspection of the aircraft revealed that the flaps were down and the carburetor heat was in position. No anomalies were found with the aircraft."
83270,"The student pilot was performing touch-and-go landings on runway 24g at Saint-Hubert airport with a Cessna 152. During the ground decommissioning phase, the flaps were raised and the power was restored. It was at this point that the engine hesitated slightly, which broke the pilot's concentration and caused him to lose control of the aircraft. The Cessna left the runway and the engine was subsequently shut down. The aircraft struck a pit and came to rest on its nose. There was significant damage to the nose wheel, the propeller, the engine and the firewall."
83237,the instructor pilot and his student were performing touch-and-go landings. shortly after takeoff at an altitude of approximately 300 to 500 feet one of the propeller blades detached. the pilot of the aircraft (aerocruiser) shut down the engine and attempted to return to the runway. on short final the aircraft struck a 10-inch diameter tree before crashing. the occupants sustained serious injuries. the aircraft was destroyed. the propeller was recovered.
82758,"During initial climb, the Piper J3 suffered a loss of power. The pilot turned around to land the aircraft on the lake. On short final, the J3 stalled and landed hard on the edge of the lake. The floats and propeller were damaged. The loss of power was attributed by the pilot to carburetor icing."
82618,"During a local flight at 500 feet above ground, the left wing of the ultralight detached. The ultralight crashed into the Richelieu River basin. Both occupants suffered fatal injuries and the ultralight was destroyed."
82229,"During the Cessna 172 takeoff roll, the instructor pilot felt a ""shimmy"" in the nose wheel. The wheel then separated and the aircraft ended up on its nose. The instructor and student pilot were unharmed. The damage was limited to the nose wheel and propeller. One of the arms of the nose wheel fork broke suddenly. The defect will be reported to Transport Canada (SDR)."""
82177,"the pilot took off from lake iroquois aboard the challenger ii type ultralight to practice landing and takeoffs. an hour and a half later, his friend, not seeing him return, became concerned and went looking for him. she found the aircraft crashed into a nose-down attitude on the frozen surface of the lake. the pilot had suffered serious injuries and the aircraft had sustained significant damage. the pilot does not remember the accident or the moments leading up to the accident. the pilot had completed his ultralight private pilot course in august 1994. he had a total of 19 hours of flight time, including 16 dual-control flights and 2 hours solo. on march 24, 1995, he took possession of a challenger ii type ultralight. the seller recommended that he consult his flight instructor and do a few hours of dual-control flight time before flying solo. The pilot did not follow this recommendation and undertook the flight in question which ended in an accident. The pilot reported that on the day of the flight the winds were calm at the time of take-off, however the first people at the accident site reported gusts of wind. Photos of the accident aircraft reveal that the aircraft hit the ice surface of the lake with the left wing first and then pitched down with the nose."
82164,"During takeoff on a frozen lake with a snowy surface, the left ski of the DC3 hit a piece of ice and tore off. Shortly afterwards, the left landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a stop. No injuries."
82043,"When landing on Lake Manitou, the DC3 on skis struck an ice formation and the skis broke. The aircraft continued to roll on its nose before coming to a stop in the snow. The crew was on their sixth trip of the day to the same lake but did not land at the same location as the previous ones. The aircraft was carrying barrels of Jet-B fuel."
81781,"At 500 feet above ground level, the pilot of the advanced ultralight experienced moderate turbulence during the initial climb. During levelling off, an excessive reduction in power led to a sudden drop in speed. The aircraft stalled, entered a spin and crashed into a ditch. The pilot has over 400 hours of flight time on airplanes. He had one hour of dual-control instruction. This was his first solo flight."
81651,"The Air Tutors Ltd. Cessna 152 was in cruise flight when the pilot felt a misfire. Moments later, the engine stopped. The student pilot made a forced landing in a field. Damage to the aircraft was minor and limited to the tail section. The student pilot was unharmed. An assessment of the engine damage revealed that the connecting rod of piston #3 had separated from the crankshaft after the main bearing melted. Air Tutors Ltd. has always purchased its remanufactured engines from Lycoming. Examination of piston #1 revealed that fatigue had initiated from the two lubrication holes at the oil ring. The fatigue cracks converged under the compression ring and allowed excessive combustion gas flow. This condition led to an increase in crankcase pressure to the point of allowing the crankshaft oil seal to come out and also oil to escape. The lack of oil allowed the engine to seize."
81535,"After three approaches, the pilot landed on a private runway measuring 1,700 feet. He was unable to brake the aircraft, a Cessna 172 which veered off the runway and overturned. The lone pilot on board was not injured. The approach was made at a speed of 80 mph using half flaps (20 degrees). The gravel runway was covered with about an inch of snow. The runway was icy. The landing was made at 60 mph in the first third of the runway. The pilot did not raise the flaps after wheel contact."
81356,"On landing the pilot of the Cessna T210 reported that the throttle was stuck. The aircraft touched down on the runway but the pilot was unable to slow below 80 knots. On the third bounce the pilot initiated a climb. He raised the wheels and raised the flaps from 40 to 10 degrees. The flaps are powered by an electric motor. When he tried to increase power the throttle was stuck at 20 inches of intake pressure. As the flaps were raised the wing lift was reduced and the aircraft descended onto the runway with the wheels up. The propeller blades and the underside of the aircraft were damaged. The pilot stated that after the accident the throttle was still stuck. However, after a two-day stay in a heated hangar, the lever could be moved without difficulty. On this type of aircraft, the power is controlled by a handle mounted on a metal rod that is connected to a push/pull cable to control the fuel meter. A tightening knob is provided near the handle to brake the rod and maintain the power at a desired level. Even when fully tightened, this braking is not capable of blocking the movement of the rod and cable. The cable sheath is covered with a rubberized casing. The control cable was dismantled. No presence of water or condensation or anomaly in the brake was detected. The cable was adequately lubricated and operated smoothly. The rubberized casing was not damaged. Examination of the cable and the aircraft did not reveal the cause of the power control blockage."
81340,"Shortly after landing, one of the right ski supports broke. The Aeronca 7AC pivoted around the right landing gear leg before coming to a stop. The aircraft suffered damage to the right wing tip and propeller."
81100,"The DHC-6 bounced slightly for the first time during landing on Runway 28 at Tete-a-la-Baleine. During touchdown at the second flare, the nose landing gear failed. Runway conditions were good. The landing gear parts were analyzed and found to have failed in overload by the impact forces applied from right to left."
80421,The Cessna 150 was on its fourteenth (14) glider towing flight. During takeoff at 100 feet above the ground the engine misfired. The glider broke away and the pilot of the C150 made a 180 degree turn and landed on the runway with a tailwind. During landing the aircraft struck another parked C150 and ended up against a farm building. For the 14 flights the flight time was 2 hours 45 minutes. After the event the fuel tanks were empty. No injuries
80213,"The pilot and one passenger were taking off in the Cessna 185 amphibious in a westerly direction over a body of water approximately 2,000 feet wide and over 6,000 feet long, oriented in a north-south direction. The takeoff roll was normal and the engine appeared to be providing full power. After passing approximately 1,900 feet, the left float struck a small hump on the west shore of the lake. The aircraft, equipped with Horton short takeoff and landing equipment, came to rest on its nose less than 50 feet from the initial point of impact. The aircraft's takeoff weight was estimated at 3,050 pounds, or 140 under the maximum allowable weight limit. according to the aircraft operating manual after corrections for altitude pressure wind and temperature the takeoff distances should be approximately 540 feet to lift the floats and 1,000 feet to clear a 50 foot high obstacle. according to the information contained in the aircraft operating manual the aircraft had the necessary performance to operate on this lake. for undetermined reasons the takeoff run was longer than expected."
80166,"After taking off from Lake Gaumard, the aircraft encountered strong downwinds. In order to escape these winds, the pilot turned the aircraft to the right to take the other exit from the lake. While turning, the right wing touched the water and the aircraft crashed into the water. The pilot and his passenger evacuated the aircraft without difficulty. They escaped unharmed."
80158,"The pilot of the Nordic II ultralight was cruising at 1,500 feet agl when the engine suddenly stopped. The pilot reported that the engine failed after two hours of flight. The aircraft had 20 gallons of fuel at takeoff. The 85-hp Continental engine was operating normally before the failure. The aircraft sustained substantial damage when it landed in an unprepared field. According to the pilot, it is likely that the engine's cam shaft broke in flight."
79945,"During the takeoff roll of the C182 from a 3750-foot runway, the pilot was asked by radio to board another passenger. The pilot aborted the takeoff at the moment of rotation when the wheels had left the ground. After the pilot cut the power and applied the brakes, the aircraft continued its roll and tore off the fence at the end of the runway before coming to a stop. The wings and elevator were heavily damaged. The nose wheel and right landing gear were torn off. The pilot stated that the remaining runway length was insufficient to complete such a manoeuvre."
79942,"During a touch-and-go aboard a PA34, the student mentioned that he had inadvertently activated the landing gear retract control rather than the flaps control. The left main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest on its left wing. The aircraft sustained damage to the left wing and left propeller."

79658,"Shortly after takeoff, witnesses saw grayish smoke coming out of the left engine. The aircraft yawed to the left and maintained its flight on the new heading. Shortly afterward, the aircraft dove toward the ground. The impact was at an angle of 60 degrees nose-down with a left bank of 55 degrees."
79604,"The pilot of the aircraft was performing take-offs and landings on the Ile Perrot runway. During the last take-off, the aircraft had difficulty accelerating even though the engine was delivering full power. The aircraft still took off, but the right wing stalled and the aircraft landed in a field at the end of the runway. During landing, the nose wheel gave way due to lateral movement on the right side. The propeller and engine cowling were also damaged. The pilot, the new owner of the aircraft, was performing take-offs with full flap because he believed that take-off performance on soft ground would be superior. Ile Perrot has a grass runway."
79539,"The pilot, accompanied by four passengers, took off from St-Hubert Airport bound for St-Ours to land on the grass runway he had prepared for this purpose. While on short final, the pilot, who was attempting to make a short landing, let the aircraft descend too low; the aircraft touched down approximately two hundred feet before the landing zone. The pilot applied the throttle but during the climb, the left landing gear struck the west side of an irrigation ditch located approximately 15 feet from the runway threshold. The left landing gear folded back, damaging the flap, which remained stuck at 30 degrees. After noting the damage, the pilot decided to make an emergency landing at St-Hubert Airport. Emergency services had been made available. The aircraft landed 110 feet before the threshold of runway 24g and came to rest on its left wing on taxiway papa. The pilot, who was familiar with the St-Ours and St-Hubert airfields, stated that he had misjudged the flare during both landings. During his last medical examination, his visual acuity had been measured and he did not have to wear corrective lenses. He was in the habit of touching down on the threshold of the runway when landing."
79503,"The pilot made a landing on a grass runway 60 feet wide and 2,000 feet long. Shortly thereafter, the left wheel sank 4 inches and the landing gear leg twisted. The left yaw caused the nose wheel to give way and the propeller to strike the ground several times. The pilot stated that he had checked the weather before leaving. In addition, he had contacted his wife who had mentioned that a major storm had hit the area. The pilot also mentioned that the severe storm that day and the heavy summer rains had kept the runway too soft."
79496,"Shortly after takeoff and while climbing, the Champion 7GCB stalled and crashed into the trees at the water's edge. The pilot managed to escape while the passenger died in the fire. The aircraft was completely destroyed by the fire."
79121,The pilot of the wheeled PA-28 decided to land on the icy surface of a lake. SAR found the aircraft using SARSAT. The aircraft capsized when a wheel went through the ice.
79096,"Following a hard landing, the front landing gear of the Ercoupe collapsed."
78792,"A section of the tail rotor drive shaft and the bearing support located aft of the oil cooling fan fractured when the pilot cut the throttle after landing. Examination of the aircraft revealed that 4 bolts connecting 2 sections of the drive shaft had not been properly tightened during the last 300-hour inspection 91 hours previously. In addition, the recheck did not detect the problem."
78757,a90q0090: the pilot lost directional control of the c-170 while taxiing during a touch-and-go on runway 24. the right wingtip was bent upward at a 30-degree angle after the aircraft spun. the wind was 168 degrees magnetic at 3 kts.
78542,"During a flight test for his PPC, the pilot of the Hughes 369D helicopter performed an autorotation and the aircraft struck the ground heavily with its tail. The tail rotor was damaged."
78405,"During takeoff, before the translation, the Bell 206B began to rotate to the right. The pilot did not control the rotation of the helicopter. He performed an autorotation which resulted in a hard landing. The aircraft came to rest on its left side."
78206,"Following the suggestion of residents and after confirming by an overflight that the tundra surface was more uniform than that of the lake, the pilot landed a DC-3 equipped with wheels/skis on the snow at the edge of the lake. During the landing roll, the pilot felt a jolt that he estimated to be less than those often felt on hard-packed snow. He felt the right landing gear collapse and immediately shut down the right engine. The wing tip crumpled as it slid on the snow and caused the aircraft to rotate to the right. Inspection of the runway used revealed that the right ski had struck a rock that was hidden by snow. The skin of the right ski was torn. The right landing gear right strut (part number 5110569) was bent just above the fork aft of the wheel. Two of the three blades on the right propeller were bent. The pilot was not injured. The following information was considered relevant: - The snow on the lake surface was hilly. - The terrain chosen for landing appeared suitable. - The rock was hidden by snow."
78183,"On her second solo flight of the day, the student pilot had difficulty landing the aircraft with full flap due to a flutter effect and performed a go-around. She returned to land using 10 degrees of flap. Upon contact with the runway, the aircraft initially bounced twice. The student pilot had difficulty countering the aircraft's tendency to drift to the left and, while trying to pull back on the control column, she inadvertently pushed on it. The aircraft nosedived and the nose wheel broke. The aircraft came to rest on the left edge of the runway approximately 2,000 feet short of the end of the runway. The student pilot was not injured. The following information was considered relevant: - At the time of landing on runway 06 the winds were between 140 and 150 degrees magnetic at approximately 5-8 knots. - The components resulting from the angulation of the runway with the winds give a tail wind of approximately 4 knots and a crosswind of 2.5 knots. - A tail wind produces a fluttering effect. - The use of 10 degrees of flap instead of full flap accentuates the fluttering effect. - Pushing on the stick instead of pulling puts an overload on the nose wheel."
78145,"the weather conditions at the destination were beginning to deteriorate. the pilot concerned, not wanting to spend the night at riviere-du-loup, decided to take off before nightfall because the runway lights were not working. after takeoff, the small oil level check door opened. the pilot, believing that the door could come off in flight, decided to return to land. on final approach at approximately 500 feet agl, the pilot had to go around a fog patch. in his concentration, he forgot to lower the landing gear. in addition, he did not hear the landing gear not extended warning and the aircraft landed with the gear retracted. the damage was limited to the propeller."

73916,The Piper PA-28 crashed on the ice in foggy weather.
73781,"Landing on Runway 24D at Dorval, the nose gear of the Cessna 404 collapsed despite the three green lights being illuminated. Preliminary examination at the accident scene revealed a mechanical failure in the nose gear."
73581,"The pilot of the Maranda was practicing ski takeoffs and landings and was going back up the runway after each landing. Shortly after the last takeoff, at about 200 feet above ground level, the engine suddenly stopped. There was not enough runway left to land the aircraft and the pilot had to land the aircraft in line with the runway centerline. The runway ends on a plateau about 50 feet above a road lined with poles and wires. The amateur-built aircraft cut a restraining cable and telephone wires before falling to the ground in a nose-down position. It sustained significant damage to the engine cowling, fuselage and wings. The pilot, who was wearing a safety harness restraining both shoulders, was not injured. After the accident, the owner of the aircraft, who holds a TEA license, checked the fuel system and found the main tank valve in the closed position. This aircraft is also equipped with two auxiliary tanks mounted in the wings. the piping from these tanks passes through a selector which has four positions either \""off\"", \""left\"", \""right\"" and \""both\"". this selector was in the \""both\"" position. from the selector the piping joins that of the main supply piping downstream of the tap of the main tank or between the tap and the fuel filter. when the tap is open and the selector in the \""both\"" position all the petrol from the auxiliary tanks can be transferred to the main tank while supplying the engine. as the auxiliary tanks have a capacity greater than that of the main tank the transfer of petrol must be stopped to avoid the overflow of the main tank. if the transfer is stopped by placing the selector in the \""off\"" position the main tank remains able to supply the engine. however if the transfer is stopped by closing the tap of the main tank only the auxiliary tanks can then supply the engine. An essential criterion for a main tank is that it be capable of supplying fuel to the engine during all phases of the flight envelope. An auxiliary tank is only required to be capable of transferring fuel to the main tank during cruise flight. Draining of the auxiliary tanks showed that there were 8 gallons of fuel remaining in the main tank and 3.5 gallons of fuel remaining in each of the auxiliary tanks. The aircraft owner stated that this amount was not sufficient to ensure that the fuel outlets of the auxiliary tanks remained covered with fuel during nose-up attitude or acceleration."""
73452,The aircraft struck two wires while cruising at an altitude of 50 feet and a speed of 40 knots. The pilot landed the aircraft to make a rough assessment of the damage and continued on to La Tuque. One of the main rotor blades will have to be replaced.

72993,pilot with one passenger on board took off from a lake with the intention of landing on a river a few miles away. as he was flying over a wooded area the pilot made a circuit in order to check the direction of the wind which appeared to be blowing hard and gusty. during a turn the pilot reported that strong gusts caused the aircraft on floats to lose altitude before throwing it against the side of a mountain. the pilot and passenger escaped unharmed and were rescued by local police authorities.
72699,"On approach for landing, the pilot was making a medium left bank turn when the right wing stalled. The aircraft struck the water surface violently, breaking the floats. It came to a stop on the water without tumbling."
72682,night landing the aircraft drifted to the left of the runway. the left wing struck the cornfields along the runway the aircraft pivoted to the left and came to rest in the field. the right wing and right main landing gear were damaged. the pilot and passengers were uninjured. the private grass runway is 50 feet wide and is bordered by cornfields. the winds were calm.
72594,pilot increased collective pitch in preparation for a hover. helicopter ground resonated as skids left concrete surface. aircraft rotated left and right as student pilot attempted to control rotation. main rotor blades severed tail boom after student pilot lowered collective. student pilot had taken ground resonance training and was familiar with recovery techniques. additional information on main rotor dampers follows.
72360,"pilot was flying under visual flight rules from st-hubert to the uncontrolled airport of la macaza (quebec). when he arrived at his destination, the pilot made an approach to runway 03 after noticing that the wind was blowing from 040 to 045 degrees magnetic at an approximate speed of 10 to 12 knots. during the approach, the pilot pulled up after estimating that the wind was blowing from the opposite direction. on short final for runway 21, a gust of wind lifted the right wing. the pilot corrected and went around but the wheels touched the runway and the aircraft bounced in the air. the pilot immediately applied full throttle and pulled back on the controls to pitch up but the aircraft hit the runway hard. the nose landing gear collapsed and the propeller touched the ground. The aircraft slid for a distance of 985 feet before coming to a stop 2,295 feet from the runway threshold."
72249,"The pilot was making a final spray pass about 3 feet off the ground when he felt a violent nausea and suffered from motion sickness. The discomfort caused him to jerk his head forward. The wheels touched the ground and the pilot was unable to right the aircraft. The main landing gear tore off and the aircraft slid on its belly until it came to a stop. The pilot believes that the forward movement caused by the discomfort caused him to push the control column forward. He stated that the aircraft was not at fault. The pilot had brought his own snack as usual and is confident that his diet was not at fault. The person who had contracted the spraying request had brought the pilot in his aircraft for a reconnaissance flight of the field to be sprayed. The pilot reported being bothered by the smell of gasoline during this flight. Exceptionally, before the flight, the pilot had filled his plane with the product to be spread. As is his custom, the pilot was not wearing a mask for the operation. The regulations do not require the pilot to wear a mask."
72132,"The aircraft's engine gradually lost power. The pilot carried out emergency procedures but without success. The pilot landed the aircraft on a lake but it capsized shortly after hitting a small island. The occupants swam to shore where they waited for three days in a small camp.

The aircraft left the runway and ended up in a ditch that bordered the runway. The airframe logbook indicates that a new tire had been installed on the right wheel with an intact inner tube on July 30, 1990 at 3914:50 airframe hours and inspected during a 200-hour inspection on June 18, 1991 at 4099.05 hrs. As the airframe is currently at 4156:22 hours, it is therefore 241:32 hours since installation and 57:17 hours since inspection. Following the accident, an examination of the wheel revealed that four of the six screws holding the rim on the brake disc side were missing. only two screws were found with their heads fractured and of the six threaded holes two had damaged threads. it occasionally happens that three piece aluminum alloy wheels of the mccauley type #c1630006-0103 crack from the threaded holes outwards and the screws lose their torque. however in this case there were no cracks on either side and the only possible reason the screws came loose is that they had not been tightened properly. at the last 200 hour inspection nothing abnormal was found. it appears however that the wheel has since been dismantled as the inner tube that was removed after the accident had been patched with a patch which was not there when the last tire was changed. there was no entry in the technical log indicating that the wheel had been dismantled since the last installation. a form (#24-0038 service difficulty report aeronautical material) will be submitted shortly to transport canada by the company's maintenance person. the missing and broken screws are cessna p/n a 1635-29 socket head cap screw mcl cessna parts manual 210 & t210 fig. 38a item 16"

60424,le pilote accompagne du proprietaire de l'aeronef effectuait un vol de familiarisation. apres un virage a inclinaison prononcee vers la gauche a une altitude d'environ 500 pieds-sol le pilote a perdu la maitrise laterale de l'appareil avant de s'ecraser dans un champ recouvert de petits arbres. le passager a ete grievement blesse. les conditions meteorologiques n'ont pas contribue a l'accident. un temoin a remarque que l'aileron gauche semblait tres eleve sur l'aile et que de fortes vibrations secouaient les ailes. l'examen de l'epave a la scene a permis de constater que l'aileron gauche avait fait une rotation de 152 degres dans l'axe superieur de son plan neutre. la bielle de l'aileron gauche a dechire la partie superieure de la fente de degagement faite dans l'aluminium de la partie arriere de la fausse poutre de l'aile. elle a egalement laisse des marques et des dechirures dans la partie inferieure de la fausse poutre de l'aile indiquant que l'aileron a fait une  rotation de 40 degres vers le bas a partir de son point neutre. l'aileron gauche a ete demonte. il n'y avait ni bosselure ni distortion significative pouvant resulter de l'impact avec le sol. sur l'aileron droit la bielle a laisse une marque indiquant une rotation de 30 degres dans l'axe inferieur a son plan neutre. l'examen d'un autre pelican club appartenant au concepteur a permis de constater que les bielles de controle des deux ailerons de l'aeronef accidente etaient attachees a des endroits differents. les plans fournis au constructeur ont ete examines et se sont averes conformes a l'installation que celui-ci avait faite. cependant le concepteur avait apporte une modification importante dans la position de l'attachement a l'aileron de la bielle de controle et les plans fournis au constructeur de l'aeronef accidente ne refletaient pas cette modification. le genre d'aileron utilise sur le pelican club est du type frise non modifie c'est-a-dire que la partie  avant de l'aileron n'est pas arrondie. ce type d'aileron peut causer des problemes serieux de maitrise tels qu'un basculement de l'aileron. il s'agit d'un mouvement vif et incontrolable de l'aileron vers le haut. les conditions suivantes peuvent occasionner ce probleme de maitrise: un ajustement des commandes placant les ailerons en position plus elevee que le plan neutre; une grande deflection des ailerons; une grande vitesse; des ailerons non balances avec un centre de gravite a l'arriere du point de rotation. en utilisant les plans non modifies qu'il avait recus du concepteur le constructeur a place l'attachement des bielles de controle d'aileron un pouce plus pres de l'axe de rotation que sur le modele modifie. ce qui a eu pour effet d'amplifier deux conditions favorisant le mouvement vif et incontrolable des ailerons; premierement un ajustement qui a place les deux ailerons en position plus elevee que le plan neutre; et deuxiemement une deflection des ailerons  de 137 degres superieurs a la position modifiee et verifiee sur l'aeronef du concepteur. la vitesse relativement grande et le centre de gravite de l'aileron se trouvant a l'arriere du point de rotation ont suffit a provoquer le mouvement vif et incontrolable qui a cause la perte de maitrise laterale suivi de l'ecrasement au sol de l'aeronef. cette enquete a donne lieu au rapport de laboratoire suivant: lp 51/88 - aileron control investigation - pelican club c-gpej (enquete sur le controle d'aileron pelican club c-gpej). conclusions faits etablis: 1. les ailerons utilises sur le pelican club sont du type frise non modifie et ne sont pas balances. 2. le centre de gravite des ailerons se trouvait en arriere du point de rotation. 3. les plans fournis au constructeur de l'aeronef ne refletaient pas la modification apportee a la position de l'attachement des bielles de controle des ailerons. causes: l'aileron gauche s'est renverse sur l'aile causant une perte de  maitrise laterale.                                                 the pilot and the owner of the aircraft were on a familiarization flight. following a steeply banked left turn about 500 feet above ground level (agl) the pilot lost lateral control of the aircraft and crashed in a field covered with small trees. the passenger was seriously injured.weather conditions were not a factor in the accident. a witness observed that the left aileron appeared to be deflected very high over the wing and strong vibrations were causing the wings to shake. inspection of the wreckage at the scene revealed that the left aileron had rotated upward 152 degrees. the left aileron control rod was torn upward from the slot provided for its motion in the aluminum rear web of the wing. it also produced marks and tears in the lower portion of the wing web indicating that the aileron rotated downward 40 degrees. the left aileron was disassembled. there were no impact marks or significant distortion that could have been caused by ground impact. the  right aileron control rod left a mark indicating a downward rotation of 30 degrees.inspection of another pelican club belonging to the designer revealed that both aileron control rods on the accident aircraft had been attached in different locations. the plans provided to the builder were examined and found to be consistent with his installation. the designer however had made a significant modification in the location of the control rod attachments and the plans for the accident aircraft which were provided to the builder did not reflect this modification.the pelican club uses unmodified frise-type ailerons that is the leading edge of the aileron is not rounded. this type of aileron can lead to serious control problems such as aileron snatch in which the aileron is violently and uncontrollably rotated upward. this control problem can occur in the following circumstances: rigging the ailerons up from neutral radical deflection of the ailerons high speed  and using unbalanced ailerons with the centre of gravity aft of the hinge axis.the builder in following the unmodified plans he had received from the designer attached his aileron control rods one inch closer to the hinge axis than those on the modified model. this resulted in the aggravation of two factors that can lead to aileron snatch: first the rigging of the ailerons up from neutral; and second an aileron deflection 13.7 degrees greater than on the modified aircraft as verified on the designer's airplane. the combination of the relatively high speed and the fact that the aileron's centre of gravity was located aft of the hinge axis was sufficient to produce aileron snatch which caused a loss of lateral control and the subsequent crash of the aircraft on the ground.the following laboratory report was completed: lp 51/88 - aileron control investigation - pelican club c-gpej.conclusions:findings:1. the ailerons used on the pelican club are of the  unmodified frise type and are not balanced.2. the centre of gravity of the ailerons was aft of the hinge axis.3. the plans provided to the builder did not reflect the modification made to the location of the aileron control rod attachment.causes:the left aileron became inverted over the wing causing a loss of lateral control.
54292,"pilot was preparing to land in a strong crosswind when a gust of wind blew him to the right. the aircraft touched down in a field at the edge of the runway but the pilot, fearing that he was going into a ploughed area, applied the throttle again. when the aircraft became airborne the left wing struck the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled before stopping. the pilot was only slightly injured because he was wearing aerobatic-type safety harnesses. the wind was at 90 degrees to the runway centreline at 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots. this speed exceeded the crosswind component for this aircraft by 10 miles per hour. findings facts relating to causes: 1. the aircraft's crosswind limit was exceeded. 2. during the go-around the pilot lost control of the aircraft. other established facts: 1. because he was wearing aerobatic type safety harnesses the pilot was only slightly injured."
54283,"Cessna took off and was between 200 feet and 300 feet when the engine stopped. The pilot attempted to place the carburetor heat control in the ""on"" position; however, when he made the selection, the control broke off in his hand. The pilot made a forced landing in the trees. There was sufficient fuel on board and the investigation did not reveal any mechanical failure that would have caused the engine to stop. The carburetor heat system was in the ""off"" position. It was not possible to determine the temperature and dew point at the time of the accident with any precision; however, they would have been close to or exactly consistent with the conditions that would have led to severe carburetor icing at any engine speed. The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the engine stoppage; However, given the ambient atmospheric conditions and the fact that the fuel heater was not operating, the carburetor icing probably reduced the air/fuel mixture to the carburetor to the point of eliminating all power. Examination of the carburetor heat control revealed that the metal cable of the selector had broken three inches from the point of attachment to the carburetor. Microscopic examination showed a number of longitudinal rub marks along the cable adjacent to the fracture site. The fractures showed characteristic signs of fatigue and indicated that the fatigue had progressively broken under normal stresses. The service manual states that this cable should be inspected every 100 hours and that its maximum life is 1,500 hours. Visual inspection did not detect any fretting; microscopic examination was required. the cable was most likely the one originally installed on the aircraft; it therefore had 2,750 hours, which was well in excess of the 1,500 hours at which it should have been replaced. this investigation resulted in laboratory report number lp 386/84 - carburettor heat cable. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the cause of the engine shutdown could not be determined. other established facts: 1. the weather conditions favoured carburettor icing. 2. the carburettor heat selector cable broke due to the extension of the incipient fatigue cracks due to normal stresses. 3. the fatigue was caused by friction wear."
54282,"The pilot took off under visual flight rules (VFR) to resupply a hunting camp. Shortly after takeoff, bad weather forced the pilot to deviate from his normal route. Unfamiliar with the terrain, he began to climb to clear the higher terrain but he entered clouds. The aircraft struck trees on the side of a mountain 100 feet from the summit. The wings and engine were damaged. The pilot usually followed a valley at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level. However, since this normal route was in the clouds, he decided to follow the bottom of the valley to continue his flight. However, he missed another valley to the right that would have allowed him to remain parallel to his normal route. The terrain began to become higher and the pilot, while continuing to climb, entered the cloud layer. he then tried to make visual contact with the ground instead of climbing to a safe altitude where he could have called air traffic control for assistance. he was within the limits of the quebec terminal control area which could have guided him by radar. before the flight the pilot did not inquire about the current weather conditions although he could have obtained them by contacting quebec. he made his decision based on forecasts that were twelve hours out and on the weather he observed over the lake at the time of takeoff. although the pilot was not legally qualified to fly under instrument flight rules (ifr) he had instrument experience and the aircraft was equipped with the minimum equipment for ifr. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the pilot did not obtain the most recent weather information. 2. The pilot continued his flight in increasingly poor weather conditions. 3. The pilot struck trees on a mountain that was in the clouds. Other established facts: 1. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was in the Quebec terminal control area and the pilot could have requested assistance from the terminal controller."
54279,"having flown over the destination aerodrome and noticed that an aircraft was parked on the threshold of runway 08, the pilot decided to land on runway 26. a few seconds after the main landing gear touched down, the nose gear collapsed. the aircraft rolled onto its nose and continued for approximately 200 feet before coming to rest on the pylon. examination of the landing gear by the technical services of the canadian aviation safety board revealed a fracture of the nose fork collar due to an instantaneous overload. the same fracture mode also applies to the fractures of the nose wheel rims. the surface of the 1,500-foot-long gravel runway had some irregularities. this runway is roughly marked with wooden signs. the loading of the aircraft brought the total weight to the maximum authorized. everything suggests that the pilot attempted a short landing because of the high weight of the aircraft, the presence of another aircraft at the end of the runway and the short landing distance available. after touchdown the nose wheel struck a protrusion in the terrain located near the runway threshold. during this impact the nose gear collar broke and no longer held the landing gear leg. when the weight of the aircraft was placed on the nose gear, the latter collapsed. the investigation resulted in the following laboratory report: lp 353/84 - nose gear fork. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot attempted a short landing because of the high weight of the aircraft, the presence of another aircraft parked at the end of the runway and the short landing distance available. 2. after touchdown the aircraft's nose wheel hit a protrusion in the terrain and the nose gear collar broke. 3. the nose gear collapsed after touchdown due to the collar breaking. other established facts: -none-"
54269,"Following an aerobatic training session, the pilot returned to the airport to conduct a visual approach to runway 27. A crosswind from the right at 50 degrees to the centerline was blowing at 15 knots. As the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at a height of 30 to 40 feet, it descended rapidly. It contacted the runway abruptly in a three-point attitude. The main landing gear collapsed and the propeller was damaged. There were no apparent defects in the aircraft that could have contributed to the accident. The sudden loss of altitude before touchdown may have been the result of low airspeed or a change in wind. The reported ground wind was not gusty, but indications suggest that the slight slope north of the runway threshold caused either wind shear near the ground or downdraft in the landing area. due to the low height the pilot did not have time to correct. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the aircraft had a high sink rate before touchdown. 2. influenced by the terrain the crosswind created wind shear near the ground or a downdraft which led to this high sink rate. 3. due to the low height the pilot did not have time to correct. other established facts: -none-"
54253,when the seaplane took off the wind was gusting. a gust lifted the cessna before it reached normal takeoff speed. the gust of wind diminished and the aircraft fell back into the water in a slight nose-down attitude. the right float entered the water and the aircraft capsized. the aircraft took off prematurely in a gust of wind when it had not yet reached lift speed. when the gust diminished the pilot lost longitudinal control because of the low airspeed. he was unable to prevent the aircraft from capsizing when the float sank into the water. findings: facts found relating to the causes: 1. the wind was strong and gusty. 2. the aircraft took off at a speed lower than the normal take-off speed. 3. because of the low speed the pilot lost longitudinal control of the aircraft when the gust of wind decreased: 4. the float sank into the water causing the aircraft to overturn. other established facts: -none-.
54247,to take off to spray a 30 acre orchard the pilot estimated that he had fuel for one hour of flight time and that this was sufficient. as the surface wind increased the pilot tightened his spraying passes to provide better coverage. after completing the last pass the engine stopped. the pilot made a forced landing in a cornfield and the right wing struck the ground. the tighter spraying passes required more fuel than expected. as the pilot was concentrating on his work he did not pay attention to the decreasing amount of fuel and he ran out of fuel. findings facts found relating to causes: 1. fuel consumption was higher than expected due to the increased number of spraying passes. 2. the pilot did not monitor his fuel supply. 3. the engine ran out of fuel. 4. the right wing hit the ground on landing and the aircraft was seriously damaged. other established facts: -none-

54228,"had stopped at lac legare to pick up a third passenger before continuing its route towards montreal. half an hour after takeoff, the seaplane struck several trees while stalling; its left wing was torn off and it came to rest in the forest on its left side with its nose down. according to the testimonies of the pilot and passengers, the plane suffered a total loss of power as it descended towards lac noir. the pilot wanted to make a pass over a cottage located on the edge of this lake, a cottage that belonged to an acquaintance of his. according to the pilot, after the loss of power, the seaplane would not have been able to glide to any of the surrounding lakes. the pilot therefore decided to land the seaplane while stalling in the trees. no indication of a technical defect was noted before the impact. the engine was tested on a test stand after the accident and was operating within the manufacturer's specifications. the tanks contained sufficient fuel for the intended flight. the sky was clear, visibility was greater than 25 miles, and there was no risk of icing. the aircraft's total weight was approximately 65 pounds over the prescribed limit and the centre of gravity was one inch beyond the aft limit. the cause of the accident could not be determined. findings findings relating to the causes: 1. the aircraft crashed into the forest for an undetermined reason. other findings: 1. the weight and centre of gravity were outside the limits."
54215,"was returning to base after a solo training flight in visual flight rules (vfr). as the aircraft was descending through 3500 feet the engine stopped and the student was unable to restart it. the pilot transmitted an emergency message and then decided to land on a stretch of road. just before touchdown the right wing struck a power line and then a telephone pole, seriously damaging the aircraft. it was reported that the instructor had assured the student pilot before and during the flight that there was sufficient fuel on board for the solo flight. however neither the instructor nor the student pilot had visually checked the fuel tank levels. the investigation established that the fuel gauges were inaccurate. when the engine stopped they showed that there was sufficient fuel for a vfr flight even though the tanks were dry. The student's training record showed that she had flown a considerable number of hours in dual control but had never been taught how to execute a forced or precautionary landing. Findings Established facts relating to causes: relating to causes: 1. The pilot failed to maintain sufficient altitude during the turn. 2. The obstacle was not seen in time to be avoided. 3. The pilot lost control of the aircraft after striking the tree. Other established facts: None."
54212,"takeoff from dorval-montreal international airport for a local training flight the pilot was cleared to practice instrument approaches. during his second approach he commanded the landing gear to lower and the circuit breaker tripped. several attempts to lower the gear were then made but the circuit breaker tripped each time. attempts to manually extend the landing gear were ineffective because the transmission could not be disengaged. the pilot requested a landing with the gear up between the runways at dorval and was cleared to do so. the following day the aircraft was jacked up and the landing gear extension sequence was repeated approximately 12 times; the electrical power was provided solely by the battery. the electrical power and the landing gear circuit were operating normally and no faults were noted. the reason for the tripping of the landing gear circuit breaker could not be determined. however, manual extension was not possible due to the deformation of the link that controls the disengagement of the landing gear motor. this deformation was the result of a similar accident that had occurred approximately two years previously. the damaged part had not been replaced. if it had been replaced, manual extension of the landing gear could have been possible. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the landing gear could not be extended by the usual and manual methods. 2. it could not be determined why when the pilot wanted to extend the gear the landing gear circuit breaker continued to trip. 3. it was impossible to extend the gear manually due to the deformation of the link that controls the disengagement of the landing gear motor. 4. the deformation of the connecting rod was the result of a similar accident that had occurred two years previously; the damaged part had not been replaced. other established facts: -none--"
53302,"was cruising between 300 and 400 feet agl in marginal weather conditions when the engine (continental c-85-12f) misfired and backfired. the pilot applied carburetor heat and increased power. however, engine rpm continued to decrease and the engine shut down. the pilot decided to make a forced landing on a small lake but the airplane struck trees before reaching the lake and crashed. the atmospheric conditions were conducive to carburetor icing. the pilot assumed it was carburetor icing and applied heat but the engine shut down anyway. it could not be determined whether carburetor icing caused the loss of power. the pilot was unable to make a successful forced landing because he was flying too low to reach the chosen location. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the engine stopped for undetermined reasons. 2. the cruising altitude was too low for the pilot to be able to successfully make a forced landing. other established facts: -none-"
53301,"The investigation into this accident was conducted by the Transport Canada Aviation Safety Board; the report was reviewed and released by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board. During a flight presentation, the left propeller was intentionally feathered in order to perform a single-engine pass. The right engine then overreached and the left propeller was turned in an attempt to restart the engine. The engine did not restart and, due to the high drag of the windmilling propeller, the aircraft lost altitude and speed. Unable to continue its flight, the aircraft crashed into the airport. The overreach of the right engine was caused by a brass screw lodged in the right propeller governor. The left engine did not restart because the mixture control was left in the choke position during the restart attempt."
53299,that he had to go around areas of low clouds the pilot took longer than expected to return to his home base. six miles from his destination the engine ran out of fuel. the pilot decided to execute a forced landing on a lake but he hit the water too abruptly and the floats and their attachment points were seriously damaged.
53292,"The pilot had just lost altitude with the engine idling when he turned on the throttle to head towards the landing zone. The engine coughed and lost power. The pilot tried to land in a clearing but hit some trees on the edge. There was only a 2 degree difference between the temperature and the dew point, ideal conditions for carburetor icing to be severe at idle."
53291,the aircraft took off and headed toward a caribou hunting area. about an hour later a distress beacon signal was received and an aerial search was initiated. the aircraft was found five hours later in a large lake. weather observations at the time of the accident showed that the area was under the influence of fog and low ceilings observations confirmed by two pilots who were in the vicinity at the time. the investigation determined that there were no mechanical deficiencies that could have contributed to the accident. it is believed that the pilot continued his flight as the weather deteriorated and lost visual contact with the terrain before crashing into the lake. findings findings relating to causes: 1. undetermined. other findings: -nil-
53283,"The pilot took off in formation with three other aircraft to return to his base. During the journey he remained in close formation with the others. On reaching his destination one of the pilots in the formation saw him descend and pass under his wing. Witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft spiral and crash into the trees. Although it is strongly suspected that the pilot was unwell, this could not be proven and the investigation was unable to establish the cause of the spiral and crash."
53261,"returning from a local flight was heard approaching the airport with the apparent intention of landing despite the fog. shortly afterwards and once the fog had lifted slightly, a worker from the terminal saw a plane crashed at the edge of the runway. the inspection following the accident revealed that the cessna had crashed on its left wing and nose with the engine running. it was considered that the pilot, who had only a few hours of flying time and no experience of instrument flying, suffered spatial disorientation and lost control of his aircraft when he entered the fog."
53260,"Returning from a local flight that lasted 20 min, the pilot wanted to demonstrate an autorotation to his passenger. He misjudged the rate of descent and flared too low. The pilot did not have time to react or apply throttle; the keel hit the ground and broke off; the aircraft landed abruptly and came to a stop 150 ft away after bouncing."
52350,landing the pilot headed at high speed towards his friend's plane. he realized too late that he was going too fast and that he was going to hit the other plane. while trying to turn he hit the tail of the parked plane.
52338,After taking off from a lake at an altitude of about 200 ft the engine lost half its power. The pilot did not use the entire length of the lake for the takeoff and when he came close to shore he turned left to return to land. During the turn the wing and left float struck the water and the aircraft flipped over. The inspection following the accident did not reveal the cause of the loss of power.
52336,600 ft above ground level the engine misfired and stopped. the pilot executed an autorotation in an open field and the helicopter landed on the right float. the landing was rough due to uneven terrain. technical examination of the engine electrical system revealed that the left magneto was experiencing a 200 rpm drop - however this anomaly could not have caused the engine to stop. however the weather conditions were conducive to carburetor icing.
52334,"was gaining speed just after takeoff from a private platform when the engine lost power. the pilot turned left to avoid a telephone pole and cables and then reduced collective pitch to perform an autorotation. nevertheless the helicopter landed hard on rough, rocky terrain damaging the skids, cargo containers, tail rotor drive shaft and tail boom. following the accident an inspection of the aircraft was carried out; this revealed that the high pressure fuel supply line to the fuel regulator had not been sufficiently tightened after a gearbox shaft change that had taken place minutes of flight before the accident. during the flight the line had become loose and caused the power to decrease to idle."
52333,"After takeoff the pilot realized that he would not be able to clear the terrain. He made a 180 degree turn to land on the lake. When the plane flared, it banked to the right, the front of the right float sank into the water and the plane capsized. During takeoff the wind seemed to be coming from the front but it probably turned and the pilot actually took off downwind."
52332,"The pilot took off from his base to perform an aeromedical evacuation after having slept only a few hours. Arriving at the airport where he was to pick up two passengers, he discovered that the short gravel runway was still in the dark. In addition, it was raining and the crosswind from the left was blowing at 15 to 20 knots. The runway lighting consisted of only six flares on empty gasoline cans, three on each side of the strip. As he rounded out in the rain and darkness, the pilot realized that it was difficult to judge his height above the ground. Realizing that he was going to land long, he put the throttle back on and landed shortly after mid-runway without being able to stop his aircraft on the remaining distance. This one sank into soft ground in which the right front landing gear wheel and both propellers were damaged."
52324,"Returning from a local pleasure flight, the pilot landed too long with a light tailwind. Deciding to do another lap, he put the throttle back on and lifted the aircraft at too low a speed. The aircraft gained about twenty feet in height then fell back to the ground, finally turning over 300 feet beyond the runway."
52319,"engine sputtered when pilot went around after descent from 3000 to 1800 feet. engine stopped after restarting for a few moments when pilot applied carburetor heat and full power. pilot declared an emergency and made a forced landing in a farm field. aircraft went over a ditch, nose down and landed inverted; nose wheel, engine mount and tail sustained significant damage. investigation suggests loss of power was due to carburetor icing."
52318,"The pilot took off with a slight tailwind and realized three quarters of the way down the runway that the acceleration was not sufficient. He therefore aborted his takeoff but overshot the end of the runway. He tried to do a hobby horse to avoid the ditch but, carried away by the momentum, the aircraft still came to a stop in the ditch. Inspection of the engine controls revealed that the mixture control cable was broken. Although this breakage did not justify the damage sustained by the aircraft, it still contributed to the loss of power on takeoff. Unfortunately, the pilot did not check the engine indications during the takeoff roll."
52307,pilot was on final approach with full flaps extended. wind was gusting. as he passed the lake shore the pilot sideslipped to lose altitude more quickly. when he tried to resume a normal slope at 60 ft/a.s.l. there was no response to the controls. the aircraft continued on its trajectory and struck the water with its left wing.
52280,was on a local training flight. on the third landing the aircraft bounced and the pilot lost directional control as the aircraft made contact with the ground. the aircraft went over the gravel shoulder where it hit a snow bank.
52273,"The pilot attempted to land in strong, gusty winds. Upon reaching the runway threshold, the landing gear struck a snowbank and the aircraft overturned."
52268,"The owner of the ski plane was giving a familiarization flight to another pilot. The owner, seeing that the other pilot was landing too long on a short runway, cut the throttle and the plane landed. The other pilot, thinking that the owner had control of the plane, did not touch the controls again. The owner finally realized the situation and took control as the plane was leaving the runway, but it was too late. The plane struck trees at the edge of the runway and was seriously damaged."
52266,"approximately an hour after departure the pilot noticed that the electric compressor was no longer working. he continued the flight for 14 minutes during which time the cyclic pitch control became more difficult to handle. the pilot decided to land and check the main rotor. ready to take off he carried out the pre-takeoff checks and the compressor operated normally. the aircraft began to vibrate when the rpm reached 2200 rpm. the pilot immediately reduced the throttle and tried again with the same results. on the third try he was able to climb to 2500 rpm but had to shut down the engine again. isolated in the woods and expecting a temperature drop to -50 degrees c during the night the pilot and passenger decided to take off. Despite strong vibrations, the engine speed was increased to 2750 rpm and the pilot applied collective pitch. The aircraft lifted, the pilot lost control and the machine tipped over to the side. In anticipation of heavy snow, the rear oleo-pneumatic shock absorbers had been fully inflated. The tail was thus raised, preventing the rotor from coming into contact with the snow. It is likely that a combination of factors - over-inflated rear shock absorbers, phase shift of one or two rotor blades due to the cold weather - caused the helicopter to enter ground resonance. The pilot had only 38 hours of flight time on this type. It is possible that he was unaware of the disastrous consequences of the resonance phenomenon."
52263,"The pilot had just taken off for his third flight of the day. At 500 ft/gl he smelled a strong odor of smoke entering the cabin. He turned around and began a rapid descent to land as quickly as possible. When the engine was shut down on the ground a fire broke out which completely destroyed the aircraft. The technical investigation revealed that the starter relay had tripped during and before the fire. The fire was probably caused by the abnormally high heat of the starter motor power supply circuit in short circuit. (lp 16/82) The pilot did not apply the emergency procedures in the event of an in-flight fire, these would have allowed him to extinguish the fire and minimize the damage to the aircraft."
52262,during vfr flight the engine stopped due to fuel shortage. the pilot made a forced landing on a snowy forest road. during landing the left wing hit some bushes on the side of the road the aircraft skidded to the left went off the road hit some trees and stopped in a small clearing. the pilot had taken off with enough fuel for 3 hours and 30 minutes of flight however 2 hours and 25 minutes after takeoff the engine stopped. it was found that the right fuel tank cap was leaking when the tank was completely full.
52261,pilot aligned with the runway centerline on final approach. on touchdown the left wing hit a snow bank the aircraft pivoted 180 degrees to the left the right wing then hit the snow bank and the aircraft skidded 150 feet before coming to a stop. the runway was not marked which made it difficult to spot against the snowy background hence the pilot's problems judging his position.
52260,"During the approach and in partial whiteout, the student pilot hit a 20-inch high snow bank located 150 feet before the runway threshold; on impact the nose wheel broke off and the propeller and engine cowling were damaged."
51384,to participate in an air demonstration the pilot received a briefing on the obstacles he was to encounter but did not perform a reconnaissance flight. since during his demonstration he was to disappear from the view of the crowd he entered a valley below the level of the airport. partially blinded by the sun he hit some electrical wires. the propeller the leading edge of the right wing the rudder and the rudder were damaged. the pilot was able to maintain control of his aircraft and land safely.
51376,During the flight the pilot decided to make a stopover on a snow-covered grass strip. His assessment of the depth of the snow was based on the estimated depth of the snowmobile tracks across the strip relative to the surrounding landscape. On touchdown the wheels sank into 6 to 8 inches of snow. The aircraft continued to sink into the snow below about 200 feet and then slowly rolled into an inverted position.
51369,the takeoff passing through 200 feet in climb the engine of the plane stopped. the pilot decided to land straight ahead but misjudged his altitude because of the shimmering water and did not flare. the plane hit the water hard the left float first then the right and then flipped over. witnesses rescued the occupants of the plane who got out of the wreckage by the right door. the inspection after the accident revealed that water caused by condensation had contaminated the fuel. the pilot had not drained the tanks properly before the flight.
51367,"The front engine failed due to lack of fuel during the descent prior to landing. The pilot decided to land on one engine rather than restart the other knowing that the rear tank was almost out of fuel. He lowered the landing gear manually while aligning with the runway. He landed long with too much speed, the plane cleared the runway and ended up in a drainage ditch."
51365,chartered was on a caribou survey flight; the pilot was to herd the animals. he dropped off two passengers who were to count the caribou and after taking off headed south at an altitude of about 500 feet toward the herd. the winds were from the south at 16 knots gusting to 23 knots. the two passengers who had disembarked saw the helicopter begin a left turn followed by a series of left-hand turns until impact. the pilot and passenger exited through the left door but were fatally injured by the main rotor blades. the accident site inspection and laboratory examinations found no evidence of mechanical failure of the engine or signs of damage to the rotor blades or flight controls. Damage to the tail rotor drive shaft and rear blades indicates that there was power at the time of the crash. The absence of marks on the main rotor blades suggests that there was some RPM as the blades did not bend down or strike the tail boom. (lp 410/81 lp 411/81) Hypothesis: The pilot reduced speed to prepare to round up the animals; during the downwind turn he inadvertently entered the \power-down\ flight envelope; the altitude of 500 feet was insufficient to regain control of the aircraft.
51363,"pilot landed two-thirds of the way down a 2,000-foot runway. the plane went off the end of the runway and stopped in a ditch 200 feet away."
51359,immediately after taking off from a small lake and while still at low speed the pilot made a 180 degree turn towards the shore. he raised the flaps and unable to maintain his altitude he crashed into the trees. the aircraft caught fire and was completely destroyed.
51354,"takeoff and at a speed of 60 mph the pilot began a climbing turn to the right. he then reduced power to display the climb regime; he had difficulty moving the propeller pitch control. the aircraft, still at low speed, entered a downwind while losing altitude. the pilot saw a log trail ahead; he managed to avoid it by extending 20 degrees of flaps but the right float struck the water and the aircraft went into an inverted position. the pilot was more occupied with cockpit tasks than with controlling the aircraft. the gusty winds and the rough terrain probably created downdrafts."
51347,"was on a low-altitude reconnaissance flight in preparation for a hunting trip and for unknown reasons crashed into a rocky river bed. According to the investigation conducted at the scene of the accident, the aircraft crashed at high speed, banked to the right and in a slight nose-down attitude. The engine was running at the time of impact."
51345,cruising flight the pilot encountered deteriorating weather conditions. unable to continue or turn back due to low fuel he made a precautionary landing on a narrow road. while taxiing the right wheel struck a bump which caused the aircraft to turn right into a shallow ditch and the aircraft entered the trees.
51344,the state of the lake the pilot noticed that its surface was mirror-like and decided to land parallel to the shore. during the approach he kept the shore on the left side of the aircraft using 20 degrees of flap. when the aircraft landed it bounced the pilot applied power and landed again. he then noticed at that moment that he was approaching a curtain of trees he tried to turn to the right but could not avoid hitting the shore of the lake. the aircraft hit rocks bounced into the trees and came to rest on its nose in a pylon.
51342,"shortly after takeoff from a body of water after scooping the aircraft struck a dead tree that was 25 to 30 feet taller than the others. the pilot did not see the tree and was therefore unable to avoid the collision. the flight path facing the setting sun, coupled with a dirty windshield, reduced the crew's forward visibility. after the collision the aircraft diverted to the nearest aerodrome where the landing was made safely."
51340,the engine misfired and then stopped during the climb. during the forced landing the float plane left the short runway and came to rest against some trees. the investigation revealed that the pilot had drained the tanks before departure but that there was still a fair amount of water in the fuel system.
51336,having flown a vfr circuit the pilot of the nordo aircraft landed on runway 32 of an uncontrolled airport. shortly after touchdown he saw a twin-engine aircraft on the same runway in front of him. he thought the other aircraft was taking off and left the runway by exiting on the right side of it. during the manoeuvre the aircraft struck a large rock 75 feet beyond the edge of the runway. in fact the second aircraft was at the end of its landing run. the pilot of this aircraft had flown a straight-in approach to runway 14 after reporting his intentions on the appropriate mandatory frequency. not having received an acknowledgement of his message the pilot thought he was alone in the airport circuit. by making a straight-in approach he did not follow the vfr arrival procedure at uncontrolled airports (aip rac 4.5.8). It seems that the first pilot did not see the other plane because he was facing the setting sun.
51329,"The owner of the autogyro was training the new owner on the machine. The latter was only supposed to do high-speed taxiing exercises but unfortunately the aircraft took off. The new owner therefore made a circuit but had to go around during the approach because his speed was too high. During the second approach at a height of 75 to 100 feet the autogyro began to oscillate and in a short time took an angle of 90 degrees with the ground. The main rotor stopped and the autogyro fell vertically. The rotor broke at the level of the control linkage attachment. This breakage was probably caused by excessive corrections by the pilot. However, the rotor control was made of soft alloy which did not meet the construction requirements (lp 271/81)."
51325,"pilot who had only 5 hours of instrument flight training was on a cross-country trip in the montreal area. he took off in special vfr weather conditions without filing a flight plan or requesting authorization from the dorval tower. after 15 minutes of flight the pilot realized that the weather was much worse than he had thought and that he could not reach his destination. he then decided to head to a more familiar area. the weather did not improve the pilot went into the clouds and called the mirabel tower for radar assistance. the tower controllers were able to identify the aircraft 22 nm northeast of the airport and heading southwest toward the ste-therese and mirabel airports. At the controller's request, the pilot said that he was not qualified for instrument flight but that his aircraft was equipped for this type of flight. The controller asked the pilot several times if he wanted to declare an emergency, but he refused. The controller tried in vain to have the pilot switch first to the 125.4 frequency of the Montreal TRSA and then to the 118.9 frequency of the Montreal centre. It appeared that the aircraft was too low to establish radio contact. Shortly afterward, the pilot stated that he was in a spiral and the radar echo disappeared."
51322,pilot with two passengers on board was on a charter flight of approximately 30 miles and was following the railway line that climbs north from the city. upon reaching his destination at an altitude of 1400 feet he began a descending left turn of 360 degrees to present himself for landing. he had just completed this turn and was at an altitude of approximately 300 feet when the engine suddenly stopped. still above the trees and seeing that he was unable to reach the helipad pad he decided to land on the railway line. upon touching down the main rotor cut the tail boom. laboratory examination of the engine (lp 254/81) and fuel (lp 255/81) did not reveal the cause of the engine failure.
51319,During landing in strong gusty winds the nose of the aircraft lowered and the latter banked abruptly to the left. The wing and the float hit the lake and the aircraft immediately capsized.
51317,"In VFR flight, he entered a stormy area. The pilot turned back towards the departure airport to remain in sight. However, the bad weather had already closed in on him. The pilot therefore continued his flight until he had 10 minutes of fuel left and then made a precautionary landing on a small racetrack. During the landing taxi, the left wing hit a pole."
51311,pilot hovered over a fast-flowing river while searching for a possible landing site in gusty winds. during the maneuver he allowed the left float to sink into the water. the current moved the helicopter toward the bank where the main rotor struck trees. the aircraft flipped over and was seriously damaged.
51309,"hovering low over a lake to allow his passenger to drop insecticide the pilot noticed and felt a loss of power. he tried to return to dry land the remaining power only allowed him to cushion the landing in water 3 to 4 feet deep near the bank. during the investigation it was found that the spark plug of cylinder #2, which had been incorrectly engaged during the last maintenance work, had come loose."
51302,"pilot was practicing takeoff and landing exercises. during the go-around for a second takeoff the aircraft began to porpoise. after bouncing three times the nose wheel gave way. the pilot had placed the elevator trim control in the \full nose\"" position."
51295,"takeoff and at a height of about 200 feet the engine stopped. the instructor took control and attempted to land in an open field but his approach was too long and he stopped in the trees. a fuel sample taken from the carburetor contained an aqueous detergent solution which probably caused the engine failure. the fuel tank had been filled from a 45 gallon drum that had previously contained car-brite, a car wash detergent. the fuel tanks and carburetor filter were not drained before the flight."
51294,"a crosswind landing (20 to 25 knots) the aircraft's speed having decreased the pilot was unable to maintain directional control. the aircraft almost went into the wind and entered a small bay where it hit trees on the edge of the lake. the wing, the horizontal stabilizer and the right float were damaged."
51293,the straight-in approach saw the pilot perform the pre-landing checks but forget to extend the landing gear. on final another aircraft presented a conflict and the tower controller asked him to turn on his landing lights and then cleared him to land. the pilot forgot to complete his checks and landed with the landing gear up.
51292,"Having dropped his load under sling on the drilling site, the pilot tried to take off again by passing over the drilling shelter and the blades of the main rotor hit the derrick tower. The pilot lost control of his aircraft which turned over and crashed."
51281,pilot attempted to take off with a crosswind component of 22 to 26 knots. during the takeoff roll he was forced to use the right brake in addition to the rudder pedals to maintain directional control. at the most critical moment his foot slipped off the rudder pedals (his soles were covered in snow) and he lost directional control. the aircraft left the runway and stopped in a ditch. the aircraft flight manual states that the maximum crosswind component for a safe takeoff is 9 knots.
51280,"showing two new pilots the force that water exerts on the floats in a strong current the pilot achieved the lift necessary for translation by pulling on the collective. the main rotor blades struck the surface and the helicopter tilted and then capsized. the instructor, due to the reduced visibility and the comments he was making, did not realize the change in attitude early enough."
51278,"the landing run in whiteout conditions the aircraft's skis struck a hardened snow bank. the right main landing gear collapsed when its fitting weakened by exfoliation corrosion broke under overload. the main landing gear, the right wing and the elevator sustained significant damage."
51272,During a hover near the ground the instructor cut the throttle to cause a simulated engine failure. The student lowered the collective to full and the helicopter made a hard landing during which the T-tail was damaged.
51268,unloading the aircraft headed for the takeoff area on this frozen lake. the ice broke up and the aircraft was partially submerged. the ice was less than 1 1/2 inches thick and the pilot unloaded his cargo by pushing the five 45-gallon drums of fuel out of the aircraft and they fell directly onto the ice. their fall probably weakened the ice cover.
51267,"a normal landing during taxiing the pilot inadvertently retracted the landing gear instead of retracting the flaps. the aircraft fell on its belly. the poor arrangement of the landing gear and flap controls, which are also identical and placed side by side, makes confusion too easy."
51266,"was equipped with a ski-wheel set. the pilot, with skis in the ""raised"" position, landed on a small lake, 90% of the surface of which was ice. during the landing run, the brakes proving ineffective and the aircraft getting dangerously close to the shore, the pilot applied full throttle to avoid a 15-foot hill. he managed to pull his aircraft away but was unable to avoid the hill, which caused significant damage to the landing gear at the front of the fuselage and to the right wing. the aircraft came to a stop some 200 feet beyond the point of impact. """
51264,"from a night vfr the pilot encountered an area where there was light snowfall that reduced visibility. while approaching his destination he received a radar vector of 110 degrees to go towards the airport. for unknown reasons he turned left to a heading of 300 degrees m which took him towards a sloping terrain. according to the elements noted on site the aircraft was in a descending left turn when it struck the trees. there was no in-flight fire, mechanical failure or airframe rupture before impact. the pilot had a reputation for being nervous. he was afraid in flight and he had never wanted to do simulated emergency procedures or instrument flight."
51263,"The pilot was flying over an isolated area as the weather conditions worsened and night fell. As he was unsure of his position, he decided to make a precautionary landing on the road. The next day, while trying to take off, the left wheel sank into soft snow, causing the aircraft to drift to the left. In an attempt to correct the situation, the pilot braked too hard to the right, causing the aircraft to veer in that direction. The aircraft hit a road sign and fell into a ditch along the road."
51262,The pilot had taken off an hour earlier from this runway but the wind had changed in strength and direction. On landing on the same runway shortly after a normal touchdown the aircraft pivoted into the crosswind at 90 degrees. The runway was clear of snow on a 40 foot drop with snow ledges on either side. The aircraft overturned in fresh snow off the runway.
51259,"pilot made a long landing too far to the left of the axis. the aircraft hit the snow bank (2.5 feet high) on the left side of the runway and the right wing touched the ground. the aircraft stopped short of the runway and the fuselage, the propeller and the tip of the right wing suffered significant damage."
50287,During takeoff on calm water and having used most of the available 7000 ft the aircraft eventually became airborne at a speed of 55 mph. The pilot lowered the nose of the aircraft to increase its speed and began a slight climb to 72 mph. As it approached the tree line the aircraft began to sink and then struck the tops of the trees.
50283,"During a low altitude, low speed final approach, the student pilot prematurely reduced power. The aircraft landed short of the runway, hit a snowdrift and turned over. The instructor noticed the error but did not react."
50282,"After take-off at a height of about 300 feet, the pilot felt a sudden yawing movement to the left. He quickly controlled this movement and continued his climb. A second yawing movement occurred and he performed the corresponding vital actions but did not feather the propeller because he could not identify the faulty engine. The aircraft then began to lose altitude and speed and began to turn to the right. The pilot corrected with ailerons and full left rudder but had difficulty maintaining control of the aircraft. After ensuring that his trajectory was clear of obstacles, he turned to the right in an attempt to join a parallel runway. The aircraft continued to lose altitude and landed heavily on the left landing gear. it bounced twice before coming to rest in the snow off the runway. technical examination of the aircraft revealed from the damage to the left propeller that the left engine was operating at the time of impact. this propeller was not feathered and was not damaged. sixteen hours after the accident the right engine was started and tested on the ground. during this test it was noted that the tachometer was faulty, that the fuel flow exceeded the limit of 40 and that the manifold pressure reached 35 inches. witnesses confirmed that the tachometer of the right engine was not working. this defect was probably the cause of the pilot's uncertainty in identifying the engine that was giving him trouble. ground tests concluded that the right engine was able to develop its full power at the time of the accident. it was not possible to determine the cause of the loss of power."
50278,the pilot was landing on a snow-covered lake to disembark two geologists and their equipment he heard a loud noise and felt the aircraft trying to nose-dive and turn to the right. he immediately applied the throttle. at 200 feet he noticed that part of the right ski was coming off. he decided to return to his base where emergency services were available. unable to retract the ski probably due to a hydraulic failure the pilot chose to land in the snow next to the runway. while decelerating after touchdown the aircraft landed on the left landing gear and the right wing tip the right landing gear having folded into the fuselage. inspection on the lake revealed that the right ski had contacted an area consisting of a 2 inch layer of ice and 5 inches of water on a second layer of ice. The right landing gear probably failed due to overload when the ski sank into the first layer of ice.
50269,"made his final approach well. However, shortly before touching down, having let his speed decrease, the rate of descent became too steep. The hard landing damaged the nose gear."
50262,with a pilot and mechanic on board failed to return to base after taking off from a camp. a search was undertaken. the wreckage was found 17 days later along the planned route and 6 to 7 minutes flying time from the camp. inspection revealed that the aircraft had disintegrated in flight the main rotor was found 350 ft from the wreckage the tail and other pieces at varying distances from the main body. further investigation revealed that the tail had been damaged in a hard landing the day before the accident. a mechanic had inspected the tail and reported that the aircraft was able to return to base. it is possible that the tail fracture was the cause of the in-flight disintegration.
50258,"The engine stopped without warning during a steep descent and the pilot was forced to make a forced landing; the float plane touched down on the shore and continued on the water. About four minutes later the pilot started up and flew his damaged aircraft to a seaplane base two miles away. The fuel tanks on this aircraft have only one fuel port each located at the rear, unlike newer models which have two ports per tank. During the steep dive, fuel was forced out of the ports and the engine ran out of fuel after consuming the fuel in the lines. The fuel level returned to normal when the aircraft stopped on the water and the pilot was able to restart the engine."
50249,"Witnesses heard the aircraft start, then reduce engine speed during the climb and then go back to full throttle. The engine backfired once or twice and stopped. The aircraft was discovered submerged in a nearby lake 48 hours later. The damage it sustained allowed investigators to determine that the impact with the water surface was at a steep nose-down angle. A technical examination of the engine revealed no mechanical defects. The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the formation of carburetor ice."
50244,"pilot was carrying a lifeboat on a sling. after takeoff it started translating too quickly and reached excessive speed. the lifeboat, which was swinging, struck the tail rotor, which then stopped. the electrical hook release device did not work due to insufficient weight on the hook and the pilot did not have time to use the emergency device. the pilot attempted to autorotate to partially reduce the torque by reducing the collective, but the helicopter turned violently to the right and crashed into the trees."
50240,"The pilot was landing on his new private runway. While rolling, the nose wheel sank into a soft spot and the aircraft turned over."
50231,"pilot departed for a vfr flight without first checking the en route weather conditions. about forty-five minutes after takeoff he found himself in an area of ​​heavy precipitation and reduced visibility. he therefore decided to make a precautionary landing in a hayfield. during the landing roll the nose gear struck a rock and collapsed, causing damage to the propeller, cowling and engine mounts."
50227,"The pilot-in-command seated in the right seat told the co-pilot that he was going to make a short-field takeoff even though the usable runway was 3,000 feet long. A passenger reported that the aircraft was airborne very quickly and that shortly after takeoff he heard a warning sound followed by a pronounced bank to the left. The co-pilot thought that they were going to stall and that if the aircraft continued on this trajectory they would hit the refueling truck. He therefore feathered the propeller of the right engine to facilitate the recovery to the right. The aircraft then slid to the left and the left wing struck an earth embankment at the edge of the runway. The aircraft then touched down losing the nose wheel and slid to the left on the ground, skidding to the left, losing the wing and the left engine; it finally came to rest on its nose. The passengers and the captain immediately got out of the wreckage but it took about 15 minutes to free the co-pilot."
50226,The pilot was preparing to land on a glassy water surface when he lost bearing during or immediately after the flare. He lost directional control and the aircraft landed heavily on the right float just before the left wingtip hit the water.
50225,"The pilot had borrowed the plane to take two friends for a ride. After a normal takeoff, the plane climbed straight ahead for a short distance and then returned over the point of departure. At an altitude of about 500 ft, witnesses saw it begin a right turn during which the nose dropped and the plane crashed into the lake in a spiral. An autopsy found that the pilot's blood alcohol level was 69% mg."
50223,"the pilot believed that his rate of climb was insufficient to avoid the trees at the end of the runway. he aborted his takeoff by extending full flaps to land on the remainder of the runway. the flare having been poorly executed, the nose gear collapsed and sank into the sand and the aircraft overturned. the 2000 ft runway was long enough to make a safe takeoff but the pilot had no experience on short gravel and sand runways. the runway was also used as a drag strip for motorists in the area so its surface was somewhat rough."
50220,touch the pilot noticed that his left wing was dropping and so he applied the throttle. having received confirmation from another pilot on the ground that his landing gear was down he managed to land. later while taxiing for another departure the right landing gear collapsed. the green light indicated that the landing gear was in the correct position even though it was not fully extended and locked. this situation can occur on this type of aircraft because the green light only indicates that the landing gear jack is at the limit of its travel. the lifting and extension rods of the left and right landing gear were deformed. the pilot was not familiar with the operation of the aircraft's landing gear or its operation in an emergency. having previously experienced difficulties with his landing gear he did not request an inspection.
50219,Two minutes after takeoff and at an altitude of 200 ft a bird struck the windshield which shattered on impact. The pilot momentarily lost control of his aircraft which began to descend and hit the tops of large trees. He was able to regain control of the helicopter and landed on an airfield two miles away.
50218,On a test flight the pilot reported abnormal vibrations which he believed to be coming from the tail rotor. He decided to make an emergency landing in a dry river bed. During the flare he turned 90 degrees into the wind and the tail boom struck a large rock.
50216,"The plane was seen flying low in the fog. The aircraft hit a high-voltage power line, crashed onto the highway and caught fire. Due to the intensity of the flames, rescuers were unable to help the two occupants."
50215,pilot reported a sudden loss of power during takeoff. he initiated a forced landing from approximately 35 ft above the water and then landed hard on the lake. the aircraft remained on its floats so the pilot restarted the engine and flew to shore. after emergency repairs the aircraft was flown to an overhaul facility. the cause of the engine malfunction could not be determined.
50213,pilot wanted to go to another airport to tow advertising banners. he had loaded the four large banners inside without securing them. during takeoff the load shifted and pushed the back of the right seat against the control column. the pilot lost control of the aircraft and a wing tip was damaged while dragging on the ground.
50207,"During an aerial survey operation, the pilot had landed several times at the accident site. During a previous inspection, he had noted the presence of a high-voltage line nearby, but not that of guy wires. Normally, guy wires are anchored to the ground at an angle of 45 degrees. In this case, in order not to interfere with the farm equipment, a steel guy wire had been suspended parallel to the ground at a height of 33 feet between two posts located 190 feet apart. During the last takeoff, while the pilot was translating towards the setting sun, he struck the guy wire, which he had not seen, and the helicopter crashed."
50203,drifted to the right during takeoff and the right skid struck a stump. the aircraft began to roll to the right but when the pilot applied left cyclic to maintain control the main rotor blades struck the ground. the helicopter spun and came to rest on its right side.
50194,pilot tried to take off from a confined area before the planned take-off speed. while approaching the lake shore he tried to make a turn but at too low a speed the plane stalled and crashed.
50193,pilot was attempting to land on an unsuitable runway he overshot his intended landing point and landed too long. taxiing speed being above normal the aircraft overshot the end of the runway. a wing hit a tree and the aircraft overturned.
50189,engine failed during final approach and the aircraft overturned during landing in a ploughed field. the aircraft on which four flights were made for a total duration of three hours had not been refuelled. the total flight time (including the accident) was 4.5 hours whereas the normal endurance of this aircraft is 4.1 hours. the pilot had not visually checked the contents of the tanks before departure.
50188,"During a proficiency check flight and during the final approach with simulated engine failure (throttle at idle), the pilot flared too high. The instructor pilot did not notice the error in time to take corrective action. The force of the impact exceeding the design weight limits on landing damaged the aircraft structure."
50182,"landing the pilot was cleared to go to the nordair hangar via the north parking area. the pilot followed the normal traffic lanes marked by yellow lines as he approached the end of the terminal the pilot saw an air canada van approaching a marked intersection. the pilot began to slow down because it seemed to him that the van did not want to stop. on the contrary, it accelerated the pilot braked sharply but the left leading edge of the wing struck the left rear of the vehicle. the vehicle was not equipped with a radio system and only the driver saw the aircraft at the last moment; the collision could therefore not have been avoided."
50175,"had been chartered for an inspection tour of weather stations located in the James Bay region of northern Quebec. It took off from Lake Helene and made stops at Lake Denys and Gulf Richmond. The departure from the latter region was quite difficult because of the ice breakup, but the pilot was still able to take off and head toward Lake Mollet, where he landed on a rough surface with many hardened snowdrifts. After refueling, he attempted a first takeoff, which he had to abort. On the second attempt, the aircraft jerked as it passed over a series of snowdrifts, then the right ski sank into one of them, forcing the landing gear leg to fold back. In parallel with this incident, the pilot had inadvertently filled the rear tank with heating oil and used it during takeoff. If the plane had taken off, the engine would surely have experienced problems."
50172,The pilot had just taken off from a frozen lake when his engine stopped at about 200 feet. He was unable to return to land on the lake and crashed into the wooded area. Apparently the engine stopped due to lack of fuel despite the fact that the tank was half full. An excessive nose-up during takeoff may have been the cause of the accident.
50169,takeoff at a height of 300 feet the engine lost some power due to carburetor icing. the pilot using the injection pump to keep some rpm made a 180 degree turn to return to the runway. thinking that he was too high to land safely the pilot preferred to make a forced landing in a field. finally the aircraft stalled and hit the ground in a right banked attitude.
50165,a turn the right airglass lw 3500 ski pivoted out of position. the pilot had to reduce the throttle and apply full aileron to keep the wings level; the aircraft gradually lost altitude until it forced a landing. the right landing gear was torn off on impact as the aircraft pivoted and skidded in the thick snow. the strut mount designed to hold the extender assembly and retaining cable in place had become loose. the two an4 bolts holding the strut mount in place had become loose and backed out under repeated vibration and flight loads. it is likely that the an4 bolts of insufficient length had been used during ski assembly.
50161,"On take-off the pilot noticed that the landing gear control would not return to neutral and that the gear in motion warning light remained on. He made several landing gear movements following which the gear up indicator light came on with a three green indication but with the gear in motion indicator. The acceleration being normal the pilot thought that he had problems with the landing gear doors. He therefore continued towards his parking area at reduced speed. On arrival he lowered the gear and had the three green lights indicating that the gear was down and locked. During the landing roll the nose wheel disappeared the aircraft rolled onto its nose and the propeller blades touched the runway and were damaged. A visual inspection revealed that the nose wheel retraction linkage mounting bolt had broken, preventing it from extending fully and locking. Despite the link being broken, the gear down and locked signal was normal and permitted landing."
50158,pilot landed hard on runway 24 at mont-joli airport in a light crosswind. on rebound the left shock absorber broke and the entire bogie detached. the aircraft slid on the rest of the landing gear leg and finally stopped on the runway. laboratory tests showed that the left landing gear link rod lock bolt broke under double-acting torsional forces. the 50-hour inspection was eight hours late. (lp 87/80)
50157,pilot attempted to take off from a lake that was too narrow. the takeoff run was increased by skis crossing a slushy area. the pilot tore his aircraft off but just avoided a row of trees at the far end of the lake. unable to climb or gain speed the aircraft stalled and crashed.
50156,"The aircraft's engine stopped on the base run and the pilot was unable to restart it. The aircraft landed in the area of ​​the approach lights. After the aircraft had been towed to the runway, the chief instructor was able to start the engine without difficulty and return the aircraft to the hangar using its own power."
50155,the landing run on a frozen and snowy lake the left ski detached from the main landing gear and the aircraft flipped over. this was the fourth ski landing of the season for this aircraft. the failure occurred at the level of the caliper attachment allowing the wheels and skis to be coupled. it was mainly caused by a ductile overload mechanism. see technical report lp 67/80. the frozen surface of the lake was covered with 15 inches of crusted snow and 4 inches of powder snow.
49169,takeoff about 15 seconds after the tear off the engine began to misfire and lose power. the pilot then pulled the carburetor heat control and operated the throttle several times. the engine regained power for a short time then lost it again. the pilot operated the injector and partially closed then opened the throttle a second time the engine came back to life for about 6 to 8 seconds then stopped. the pilot made a forced landing in a field after a 90 degree turn.
49166,During a right turn on the company's packed snow and ice covered apron the nose gear collapsed and entered the forward fuselage section. The failure began with the fracture of a stud in the nose gear steering mechanism which allowed the nose wheel fork to release the down lock.
49162,20 minutes after departure the pilot entered an area of ​​bad weather. instead of turning around he made a precautionary landing on a frozen lake. during the landing roll the nose gear engaged in slush and the aircraft nosedived damaging the right wing and the propeller blade tips. after examining the aircraft and seeing that the damage was negligible the pilot took off again to return to the starting point.
49161,landing the pilot skied his plane close to the shore. when the plane's speed decreased the ice broke up and the plane landed in 4 feet of water. although reports indicated a thickness of 10 inches of blue ice the strength and thickness of the ice near the shores were less as they were dependent on currents. the pilot was not aware of the differences in ice conditions.
49159,"During the touchdown flare, the student pilot lost directional control and drifted to the left over the rough grassy terrain bordering the runway. As he attempted to return to the runway using the rudder and brakes, the landing gear to fuselage attachment broke. The student had flown solo for a period of 30 days without instructor supervision."
49158,"The pilot took off prematurely from a small lake. While trying to clear a curtain of trees on the shore, the plane stalled and crashed to the ground."
49154,"was flying circuits on his third solo flight when his aircraft began to bounce on landing. He applied the throttle to take off again but the nose wheel came off on the next bounce. The aircraft went off the runway, went through a ditch and came to rest on its nose."
49150,witnesses saw the aircraft pass overhead at low altitude heard the engine reduce revs and then observed the aircraft enter a left turn ending in a spiral descent. after seeing the aircraft disappear behind the hill they heard it crash to the ground. the investigation revealed that it was in a nose-up attitude when the floats began to strike the trees and the propeller struck a large tree. the aircraft then crashed to the ground almost vertically. it appears that the aircraft was at its maximum weight with the centre of gravity within limits. as a load had been hung under the aircraft the performance was modified so that the stall speed was higher. once in a spiral the pilot no longer had enough height for the resource.
49148,engine stopped at about 650 ft during climb after takeoff. pilot did not attempt to restart engine due to low altitude and was forced to land with flaps in trees where floats tore off. engine ran out of fuel due to fuel pump shaft breakage and pilot not using electric pump for takeoff and climb. poor lubrication caused partial seizure of pump drive pinion and shaft breakage. water and sediment were also found in fuel filter. (lab report lp 250/79)
49147,"pilot had departed late in the afternoon for a daytime vfr flight to his home base. the flight was to last 45 minutes; the float-powered aircraft had enough fuel for a 2-hour flight. the pilot got lost and after 1 hour and 50 minutes of flight, with night having already fallen and the fuel remaining being critical, the pilot, not qualified for night flight, decided to make a precautionary landing on the dark water of a large river. during the approach he misjudged his altitude, did not flare and crashed into the water."
49146,About 1 1/2 miles from destination the engine ran out of fuel. The pilot made a forced landing on soft ground and the aircraft overturned. The pilot had not gauged the fuel tanks before takeoff and had not taken into account the additional consumption for three stops en route with takeoffs and climbs.
49145,engine lost power during takeoff in rough water. three-quarters of the way across a 4000 ft long lake the pilot initiated a tight right turn to avoid high voltage wires. the aircraft struck the water and crashed on shore. it could not be determined with certainty whether the loss of power was due to carburetor icing or water ingestion during the takeoff roll.
49143,At the time of landing the pilot executed his flare too high and let the aircraft bounce. The correction was inadequate and the aircraft bounced a second time which damaged the nose wheel. After a third bounce the aircraft finally crashed on its nose after the nose gear collapsed.
49138,turned over during the takeoff roll when a gust of wind lifted the left wing. The lake is located in the middle of a rugged terrain that causes turbulence in high winds.
49135,"The crew members communicated with Frobisher's FSS station at 22:31. when they learned that the weather conditions were below the vfr minimum they requested a \vfr special\"" which was granted at 2235. the poor weather conditions prompted the pilot of another aircraft to agree to land on runway 36 with a tailwind of 20-25 kts. this pilot landed at 2237 and reported that the ceiling was 800 ft/gl. the crew of c-grow acknowledged receipt of the information. according to another bulletin the weather conditions at 2244 were as follows: ceiling at 400 ft visibility 8 mi and constant wind at 20-25 kts. after asking the fss specialists to repeat the visibility the pilot indicated his intention to make an ils approach with a forward alignment on runway 36 and then land on runway 18. during his last transmission it reported as being in the outbound leg at the altitude of the conventional turn. according to witnesses the aircraft headed in the axis of the runway towards the north then turned right. some witnesses saw a fire. the aircraft struck the ground on high ground 1200 ft east of the runway at 100 ft above runway level. the wreckage was consumed by the fire which broke out on impact. following an approach they to the entrance to runway 36 the crew apparently decided not to land probably because of the strong tailwind. the pilot instead decided to make a 360 degree turn on the north side of the runway. The flap and aileron control rods were examined and found no evidence of failure prior to impact. The investigation also found that the propellers had positive pitch and the engines were developing power at the time of the crash. (see LP 279/69 LP 141/80 LP 270/79)"
49133,"During a maintenance check flight, the pilot performed a full autorotation landing. The helicopter landed hard and the main rotor blades severed the tail boom."
49120,miles before reaching the destination the engine stopped due to fuel starvation. the pilot then made a forced landing in a small marshy clearing. before the first takeoff the pilot had ensured that both tanks were full. he had made two flights lasting a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes. it is suspected that the fuel leaked from a leak at the fuel indicator seal on the left tank.
49117,was heading towards the great whale river. a little before reaching the destination the fog appeared and then became thicker and thicker. finally the pilot decided to turn around but he lost visual references and the plane crashed tail first.
49116,"novice pilot attempted to take off prematurely from an unsuitable portion of the grass strip. directional control was lost and the aircraft rolled to the left, struck an abandoned railway line hidden by grass and then overturned."
49115,"pilot who had not flown this type of aircraft for 8 1/2 months was seen flying at very low altitude on the edge of a country road. arriving near a car parked on the side of the road the pilot made a steep climb left turn while waving to the driver of the vehicle. during the turn the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed in the field to the right of the vehicle, fatally injuring the pilot. the post-mortem autopsy revealed that the pilot's blood alcohol level was high."
49114,floats plunged into the water and opened as the pilot was executing a flare over a glassy body of water. The plane sank in deep water (200 feet).
49101,climbing to about 100 feet agl the pilot reduced throttle and pitch and retracted flaps to 10 degrees. he then set the mixture to 18 gph and at the same time the engine misfired for a few moments and then stopped completely. the pilot landed straight ahead in the trees bordering the lake. a large deposit of corrosion debris and water was found in the fuel filter.
49098,"The helicopter was transporting hydro employees to a construction site near Nemiscau. After flying about 5 miles, visibility decreased due to fog. The pilot finally decided to perform a precautionary landing. At the time of landing, the pilot lost horizontal visibility and the aircraft struck an elevation, rolled down a hill and caught fire. The pilot was ejected."
49094,The pilot apparently attempted a tight 180-degree turn into the downwind direction immediately after takeoff; the crop duster crashed and burned. The seriously injured pilot nevertheless managed to evacuate the aircraft before it was consumed by flames.
49087,"During the takeoff run, the aircraft was blown off course by a strong gusty crosswind and left the runway. The pilot attempted to continue the takeoff rather than abort it, but the ski/wheel assembly collapsed when it hit a gravel mound at the edge of the runway."
49079,"the approach the pilot was explaining to the passenger/owner the procedures specific to this aircraft. his attention thus occupied the pilot forgot to carry out his pre-landing checks. he did however confirm twice to the tower that his landing gear was \down and locked\"". the aircraft landed with the landing gear retracted."
49076,"pilot who had just purchased this aircraft with conventional landing gear decided to make a test flight with the previous owner in order to familiarize himself with the aircraft and its particular landing technique. after a demonstration flight the pilots changed places. the new owner at the controls for the first time took off without any problems and headed for another airport whose landing strip was more suitable for practice. on the first landing the aircraft bounced twice and the pilot, unable to control his aircraft, asked the previous owner to take the controls. before the go-around could be applied the aircraft was engaged in a 30-degree banked left turn. the aircraft stalled, rolled to the right and crashed in a nose-down attitude from a height of about 30 feet. there was turbulence at the time of the accident due to a crosswind."
49072,"Following a normal landing and a 1500 foot roll the landing gear collapsed. The investigation established that an incorrect adjustment of the right main landing gear and nose landing gear limit switches allowed the landing gear motor to move the transmission beyond the lower limit, causing damage to the floor support. On landing the drag links holding the landing gear in the down and locked position were displaced by the drive cables and when the full weight of the aircraft rested on the landing gears, the latter collapsed."
49071,"tail wheel was seriously damaged during an attempted three-point landing. the aircraft rolled approximately 175 ft before rotating to the left. the pilot attempted to take off again but the aircraft collided with a snow bank, further damaging the main landing gear and propeller."
49065,from a landing in blowing snow kicked up by a 90 degree crosswind the aircraft's main landing gear struck a hardened snow bank at the threshold of the ice runway. the right landing gear collapsed during the landing roll but the aircraft remained on the runway. the pilot did not see the snow bank until he was on short final due to blowing snow.
49053,avoid taxiing too long the pilot began his takeoff from an intersection leaving behind him approximately 2150 feet of runway and 450 feet of usable ground. the wheels were only 2 feet off the ground when they struck a 4-foot high snow bank at the end of the runway. the aircraft overturned and came to rest against the aerodrome fence.
49050,"On takeoff the pilot heard a loud noise after selecting the gear in the retracted position. When selecting \gear down\"" he noticed that the nose gear was not locking in the extended position. A ground observer was able to confirm that the gear was not fully extended. On landing the pilot took care to gently bring the nose onto the runway, thus avoiding further damage to the aircraft. The retraction linkage had broken due to excessive stress."
49046,"was on the last leg of its final approach slightly to the left of the runway centerline when it struck a snowbank. The aircraft bounced and then landed on the runway causing damage to the left landing gear, the fuselage and the wing spars."
48054,The pilot was attempting to maintain visual flight in deteriorating weather conditions. He became disoriented and lost control of his aircraft. The wreckage was found on a small lake. The descent trajectory through the trees indicated that the aircraft was in a pronounced nose-down attitude and a steep right bank angle at impact. The damage also indicated a very high airspeed.
48051,"left its base in Rockcliffe to go to a maintenance center in Quebec to have unspecified maintenance work carried out. The hangar at this center having been destroyed by fire, this work could not be completed. On the return trip, the engine slowly began to seize due to lack of lubricating oil. It appears that the pilot tried to reach the Ottawa River to land there. Due to its reduced available power, the aircraft lost altitude and the pilot was finally forced to prepare for a forced landing in one of the agricultural fields in the area. Unfortunately, he made this decision at the last second while he was downwind and he had to make a low altitude turn at low speed and reduced power. In the middle of the turn, he skidded and crashed. the oil vent line had frozen and the pump was forcing oil out of the aircraft through the crankshaft oil seal. a v-shaped opening in the vent line just above the manifold was provided to prevent icing problems. the manifold, which appeared not to have been drained for some time, and the portion of the vent line where the opening was located were iced over."
48050,Before the wheels touched down a witness noticed that the aircraft's nose gear was half-extended but the main gear was correctly lowered. On landing the nose of the aircraft collapsed onto the runway as the speed decreased. The pilot had confirmed during the pre-landing checks that the green light was on but he did not announce the position of the mechanical indicator that confirms the position of the nose gear. The investigation found no evidence of technical failure in the nose gear system.
48045,"Witnesses saw the aircraft manoeuvring at circuit altitude while the pilot was apparently trying to line up with the runway. The aircraft banked at about 70 degrees and it then crashed in a near vertical dive. It was pitch black and the pilot had already tried twice to line up with the upstream end of the runway. The local radio operator had just reported to him that the wind was favouring the other runway. The pilot had experienced transmission problems and was changing frequencies as he manoeuvred. He apparently lost visual references to the unmarked terrain, stalled at a high bank angle and was unable to re-establish them before crashing into the ground."
48044,initial climb the pilot reported difficulty maintaining airspeed and rate of climb. believing the engine was not developing full power and fearing a possible engine failure the pilot made an emergency landing in an open field near the runway. on landing the aircraft struck a buried rock and overturned. the runway was located between hills and was susceptible to the effects of updrafts and downdrafts. excessive engine rpm loss while the pilot attempted to climb into a downdraft.
48038,during the take-off run on a narrow country road the right landing gear wheel sank into the soft ground at the edge of the road. the plane lurched and crashed into a ditch.
48034,"that the pilot was demonstrating an engaged autorotation on landing, the skids hit a ditch and the aircraft capsized."
48030,Witnesses observed the aircraft lift with difficulty during takeoff. The aircraft then stalled in a near vertical dive and crashed. The difference between takeoff speed (70 mph) and cruise speed (85 mph) was only 15 mph.
48026,shortly after takeoff in gusty winds the passenger door suddenly opened. this distracted the pilot and created additional drag on the already overloaded float plane. the aircraft was therefore unable to clear the rising terrain. the pilot attempted to return to the lake but after turning 250 degrees one wing struck a tree the aircraft crashed and was almost completely destroyed by fire. the investigation was unable to determine the condition of the door locking mechanism. the technical documents showed serious deficiencies in the maintenance of the aircraft so it is possible that this mechanism was in poor condition.
48025,"was hovering a few inches above a cramped, stump-cluttered landing area when a gust of wind caused it to drift to the right. The right skid struck a stump and the aircraft rolled over before the pilot could trim the cyclic."
48022,"The power loss occurred shortly after takeoff and the pilot entered an autorotation over rough terrain. The helicopter made a hard impact and the main rotor blades bent and severed the tail boom. The pilot knew before takeoff that he had little fuel remaining and ignored the low fuel light, which had been faulty on previous flights. The engine stalled at 50 feet."
48018,"that it was too high and that it would go off the end of the runway, the pilot applied full flaps. the plane quickly lost altitude, touched the runway with its nose gear and bounced. the pilot applied full throttle but the engine did not react. seeing that the end of the runway was approaching, he panicked and cut the throttle; the plane crashed and the nose gear collapsed."
48015,Pilot reported that after a normal landing he made a 180 degree turn and was heading back up the runway when the nose gear collapsed. The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the incident.
48004,"amateur-built aircraft made two consecutive right turns. According to witnesses, the turns were too tight and were made at too great an angle of bank. According to these witnesses, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a spiral. The pilot had not had a license since 1965 and had only limited experience on this type of aircraft."
47997,"After takeoff, the pilot felt a loss of power and immediately rested. The aircraft touched down on the runway with the landing gear in motion, traveled 230 feet past the end of the descending runway before stopping. No engine failure could be found to explain the loss of power. The pilot was fatigued and interpreted the propeller pitch change as a momentary loss of power."
47995,pilot landed facing the setting sun he flared too late touched down very hard and the landing gear was damaged. the pilot was not wearing sunglasses it had been suggested to him to land on the opposite runway.
47993,pilot bounced on landing. all his efforts to correct the bounce only accentuated the successive bounces and the nose wheel disappeared. the pilot was not very familiar with the procedure to use to cancel bounces and had only very limited knowledge of this type of aircraft.
47988,"During a water landing on a glassy surface of water, the pilot flared too late and the plane hit the water surface in a slight nose-down attitude. One of the floats broke off, a wing hit the water surface and the plane sank."
47986,"The pilot was ferrying the plane from Rimouski to Causapscal. About 10 miles from the destination aerodrome, the engine stopped and the pilot had to make a forced landing. During the landing, the left wing and main landing gear were damaged. The failure was caused by cylinder No. 3; the plane had only flown 17 hours in the last 12 years."
47984,"Before the landing, the engine stopped during descent. The pilot had not used the carburetor heat, although the atmospheric situation predisposed the carburetor to icing. The pilot was unable to restart the engine and made a forced landing in the trees."
47983,"A sudden change in wind direction created turbulence and gusts while the pilot was on final approach. Once landed, the aircraft was in a strong tailwind. The pilot applied the brakes for 700 feet on the runway and for 500 feet beyond the end of the runway before the aircraft came to a stop in trees. The student pilot was required to perform touch-and-go landings in hazardous weather conditions associated with the development of cumulonimbus clouds in the aerodrome area."
47982,vfr flight the pilot landed on a lake after encountering poor weather conditions. as the weather improved the pilot was in the process of taking off when a motorboat hidden by an island cut into his path. the pilot pulled the aircraft away to avoid a collision but his substantiation speed was insufficient the aircraft fell back and capsized. the pilot had been able to avoid the collision by aborting the takeoff.
47977,"At a cruising altitude of approximately 2,000 feet, the engine stopped abruptly due to fuel starvation. The pilot made a forced landing 2 miles before arriving at Alma airport. During the landing, the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft sustained significant damage. The left tank and fuselage tank were empty, while the right tank was full. Since the two tanks are connected by a line, it was concluded that the line was clogged at the right tank filter."
47976,made a hard landing and bounced. on the second touchdown the aircraft landed on its nose the landing gear collapsed the left wing and propeller were seriously damaged. it could not be determined whether the aircraft had a valid certificate of airworthiness and whether the pilot was licensed.
47973,"The air show was held at Saarland Airport (also known as St. Vital). While not officially participating in the event, the pilot was performing aerobatics for the enjoyment of the spectators. He did a series of loops when the plane went into a spin and disappeared behind the curtain of trees. The plane crashed into a forest."
47971,pilot landed in a gusty crosswind and flared too high. the wind lifted the left wing the right wing dropped to touch the water and the plane flipped over.
47970,cruise stabilized at 3000 feet over mountainous terrain the engine began to vibrate heavily followed by a drop in rpm the pilot made a forced landing in the only available field the approach was made too high the pilot landed long and the aircraft flipped over engine inspection revealed a ruptured exhaust valve on cylinder no. 3.
47969,On takeoff and in a right turn the pilot lost control of his aircraft. The aircraft pitched vertically and crashed into a wooded hill. No faults were found on the airframe or engine. The weather conditions at the time of the accident did not allow for VFR flights. Low clouds and fog reduced visibility and obscured the peaks of the surrounding hills. The pilot had only flown 7 hours of instrument training.
47962,During a local flight at 2000 feet the engine began to cough and then returned to normal. The pilot did not attempt to investigate the cause of the problem and when it recurred he decided to make a forced landing on a secondary road. After a successful touchdown the pilot lost directional control during the landing roll and the aircraft went into the pit. An examination of the engine revealed no reason for the malfunction. It is possible that the carburetor had frozen. The pilot had limited knowledge of the symptoms of frozen carburetors and how to deal with them.
47961,Shortly after take-off the engine failed. The pilot attempted to make a forced landing in a swamp and the aircraft turned over. The technical investigation showed that the microswitch on the throttle was out of order and that the mixture was therefore too rich.
47959,Shortly after touchdown on a gravel runway the aircraft flipped over and came to rest on its back. One witness stated that the right landing gear folded back. The pilot claims that the brakes locked after touchdown although one witness said the wheels were spinning freely after the accident.
47958,"veered left during landing roll, hit a snow bank at the edge of the runway and rolled over. The student said he was monitoring the flaps for retraction before applying the power to take off again."
47956,"was unable to achieve the lift speed appropriate for takeoff, probably because of the snow. The pilot pulled back on the stick to get the aircraft airborne, but the tail hit a snow bank and the aircraft flipped over in the snow."
47954,single engine demonstration exercise in the vicinity of the airport the instructor simulated a left engine failure by pulling the throttle during the climb after a go-around. the student responded by simulating a left engine feathering and retracting the landing gear. vibrations occurred in the left engine and could not be eliminated by operating the throttle and carburetor heat. the instructor initiated a left turn to land parallel to the runway he had just left. the left engine was shut down which eliminated the vibrations and the landing gear was extended. during the previous leg the aircraft was flown to describe a teardrop approach. the aircraft had lost altitude during its maneuvers and it was necessary to retract the landing gear. the aircraft struck several trees and stalled and struck the ground in a nose-down attitude. The weather conditions in the area were conducive to carburetor icing and examination revealed no other cause of engine failure.
47951,the landing run while he was landing at night the pilot applied full throttle to avoid an unlit aircraft on the runway ahead of him. his aircraft gained enough height to avoid a collision but it stalled in a snow bank at the side of the runway.
47949,"which had been chartered to carry fuel was loaded with 20 barrels of \jet b\"". the barrels were stacked in two rows of ten and tied in groups of five with wooden blocks and a nylon strap for each group. this cargo had shifted the center of gravity beyond the permissible aft limit. during takeoff and climb one of the tie-downs broke and the load shifted aft. the pilot did not notice this movement of the cargo and was able to compensate for level flight. on approach the speed was reduced and the flaps were lowered to 15 degrees. it was necessary to further trim to almost full to lower the nose of the aircraft. the speed was further reduced to 75 knots and the flaps were lowered to 30 degrees. the aircraft pitched up as the elevator became ineffective The plane stalled and landed heavily on the ground."
47948,"Before touching down, the aircraft stalled and landed abruptly."
47945,had taken the aircraft to 500 ft agl during a precautionary approach exercise and then handed over the controls to his instructor because at that point he was no longer sure how to proceed. The instructor therefore took over the controls to 100 ft agl and then asked the student to go around. The engine did not respond and during the forced landing on a road the aircraft struck a snow bank. The instructor had not taken into account the operator's instructions which prohibited any such approach below 500 ft agl and he had not taken care to keep the engine warm.
47940,"During a partial whiteout landing on a runway covered in deep slush, the aircraft rolled left into a snow bank 6 to 15 feet from the edge of the runway. The aircraft then spun out of control to the left and came to rest in the deep snow next to the runway."
47937,During a go-around after a forced landing exercise the engine misfired due to excessive cooling caused by temperatures of -22 deg C. The instructor had to perform a forced landing in deep snow during which the aircraft was damaged.
47936,"In a hurry to clear the runway due to the density of landing traffic, the pilot changed radio frequencies and, in doing so, turned his attention inside the cockpit. The aircraft left the taxiway and struck a snow bank approximately 30 feet from the landing runway."
47935,"After landing on a snow-covered runway, the aircraft overturned. The pilot had received erroneous information from an unqualified airline employee about the condition of the runway. The snow was approximately 18 inches deep."
47934,"During the landing race, the aircraft swerved to the left and hit a snow bank."
46965,"pilot attempted to land on a small lake in gusty winds. he was unable to land at the intended location due to turbulence and applied the throttle too late. the aircraft crashed into the trees at the end of the lake. based on the weather conditions at the time and the altitude of the terrain around the lake, it was too small for a landing."
46962,The field was suitable for takeoff but mud and ice on the skis prevented the aircraft from reaching takeoff speed on the first two attempts. On the third attempt the pilot kept full power for longer but it was obvious that even if he did take off he would not be able to avoid the wires and a fence at the end of the runway. So he aborted his takeoff and made a turn which resulted in the skis sinking. The aircraft came to rest on its right wing and nose.
46961,"After taking off with a tailwind, the aircraft was forced to make a tight left turn to avoid hitting another aircraft and it stalled."
46960,"During a single-engine training flight, the running engine stopped. The pilot then tried to start the other engine but was unsuccessful, probably due to the excessive cold. He had to land in a field."
46959,"During the takeoff run, the aircraft struck a snow bank and the nose gear, engine cowlings, engine mounts and propeller were damaged. The instructor had not provided adequate supervision to the student pilot before letting him take off."
46958,"The pilot made a hard landing and went around. Due to damage to the right landing gear on the first contact with the runway, the aircraft turned uncontrollably to the right on the next touch, damaging the right wing."
46954,"The pilot made his downwind approach. The aircraft made contact in the second half of the runway, overshot the end of the runway and struck a fence."
46950,taking off from a lake the pilot felt that his plane was not climbing normally and that he would not be able to pass over the trees on the shore. he closed the throttle and landed on the water about 350 feet from the shore. the plane reached the shore on its way damaging its floats and a wing.
46944,"The right front landing gear collapsed shortly after the start of the landing roll. The crew had no reason to suspect that the right landing gear mechanism was malfunctioning, since both the gear down indication and the horn operate by means of a microswitch on the left main landing gear. The landing gear was still indicating \down and locked\"" when the aircraft was lifted off the runway."
46941,"the aircraft was aligned for the approach to a lake and spun and crashed. the pilot regained consciousness 90 minutes later but could not recall the accident. a witness saw the aircraft moving in an \unusual\"" manner between 300 and 400 ft agl before hearing the crash noise. the cause of the accident could not be established."
46938,"rounded too high, landed hard, bounced and hit the nose gear which collapsed while the left wing hit the ground."
46928,Engine lost power during initial climb. Pilot attempted to return to the field but landed before it and hit a ditch.
46915,The plane skidded during takeoff and hit trees along the runway.
46913,"Having completed a spraying pass, the pilot began a climbing turn to the right and then turned left. The plane was seen to tilt to the right and then to the left as if entering a spin and then crash almost on its back into the trees."
46906,During a takeoff in a gusty crosswind the left wing lifted and the right float sank causing the aircraft to capsize. A sufficient takeoff run into the wind would have been possible by starting a little further out on the lake.
46897,During a VFR flight the pilot entered an area of ​​fog and low stratus which after a few miles forced him to land on a road. During the approach the right front landing gear was torn off by a telephone wire that was passing over the road.
46894,"landed hard and bounced. Having decided to go around the runway again, the pilot applied the throttle and retracted the flaps. He was unable to maintain directional control and the aircraft left the runway and ended up in the brush."
46892,pilot lost control of the aircraft while landing. the tip of the right wing touched the water and the aircraft turned over. a police officer saw the passenger come to the surface and then dive to bring the pilot back. the pilot also came back up but the rescuer's body was never found. the pilot had very little experience on seaplanes.
46889,"During an aborted takeoff, the aircraft left the runway, hit two vehicles and stopped in a ditch."
46886,"The aircraft's engine stopped on final approach due to lack of fuel. Unable to reach the river by gliding, the aircraft had to land in a farm field where it overturned."
46880,bounced on landing and then fell back on its front floats. The floats failed and the aircraft sank. The pilot had never operated on water and had not flown for a year. The airworthiness certificate had not been renewed since 1974 and it is suspected that unauthorized maintenance work was carried out on the aircraft.
46868,from a first solo flight the student pilot had successfully completed two landings and was making a third takeoff. at about 100 feet in the air the left engine cowling panel opened. the pilot cut the throttle but the runway was too short to avoid a collision with a high-voltage wire. the pilot put the throttle back on and pulled the stick sharply. the aircraft slowly gained altitude at a very steep angle and then nose-dived almost vertically to the ground.
46867,"During an autorotation exercise, the student applied collective pitch while performing the flare, which reduced the rotor rpm. The instructor took control and decided to continue the autorotation until touchdown with the engines cut - without success."
46866,from a water landing on a very rough snow-covered lake the left ski broke causing a forced turn to the left and causing damage to the left wing and the left horizontal stabilizer.
46860,engine stopped 35 minutes after takeoff due to lack of fuel. neither the operator nor the instructor followed the instructions for checking the aircraft's fuel level before takeoff.
46858,The pilot was trying to make a short landing at night when the aircraft hit a snow bank and landed before reaching the runway.
46854,final approach the pilot could not see the runway lights buried under the snow. the aircraft touched down next to the intended location and turned over. the evacuation of the passengers was difficult as the aircraft rested on its canopy.
46853,"After take-off, the pilot smelled an abnormal smell of burning rubber. The smell disappeared as soon as the cabin heater was turned off. The pilot nevertheless decided to land on the runway in visual approach but due to the reduced visibility he had to carry out an ADF approach. The weather conditions at the limits of visual flight on departure had in the meantime fallen below the IFR limits and carried risks of white mirage. Once the landing clearance had been received, the pilot landed on an unapproved runway reserved for aircraft on skis located 500 feet to the left of the instrument runway parallel to it and marked by trees in the same way. After touchdown, the nose gear sank into the snow and the aircraft overturned. (lp 28/77 lp 29/77 lp 30/77)"
46852,The thick fog caused the pilot to want to end the flight but lost visual contact and made a precautionary landing. The aircraft landed hard and both landing gear legs collapsed.
46847,During take-off from a rough surface the aircraft bounced. Its low speed did not allow it to remain lifted for long and it landed hard on its right ski. The ski stirrup broke and the aircraft did a wooden horse. The investigation revealed that its breakage was due to overloading. See technical report lp39/77.
45874,cruise flight engine stopped. forced landing on a road was not successful. carburetor is assumed to have iced up.
45871,"The airplane battery was low and the engine was jump-started from an automobile. The student was in the airplane but exited to allow the instructor to perform the ground run. Instead of exiting on the trailing edge of the wing, she jumped off the leading edge and the propeller struck her hand."
45864,"was returning from a two-hour cross-country training flight when the engine began to run erratically. The pilot adjusted the carburetor heat but the plane was already too low, forcing the pilot to land. The weather conditions were conducive to carburetor icing."
45861,The pilot was departing from LG-2 towards Matagami when the weather conditions worsened. The pilot decided to land on a road as a safety precaution. The wheels sank into a snowdrift and the plane flipped over.
45858,engine failed at 2000 feet while flying over a large body of water. several attempts to restart the engine as the plane glided toward shore were unsuccessful. the pilot decided to make a forced landing on a road but the plane struck a power line during the approach.
45856,"The pilot was practicing autorotation without the engine. He attempted to extend the glide and let the engine speed drop, which resulted in a high vertical descent speed. The aircraft landed abruptly and the rotor blades struck the fuselage boom. The helicopter bounced in the air and, due to the instability of the steering, struck the ground in lateral translation and rolled over on its side."
45854,was damaged during a forced landing in a rough field following a complete loss of power. Both fuel tanks contained a large amount of ice. The fuel system of this aircraft did not have a means of draining the fuel tanks.
45853,of directional control during a crosswind landing attempt.
45848,During an attempted landing on a narrow road the left wing struck a tree causing the aircraft to veer left and roll down a 50-foot embankment bordering the road.
45845,The engine stopped shortly after takeoff due to lack of fuel. The gauge was faulty and the pilot did not check his tanks before takeoff.
45843,"The pilot was flying close to the ground, indicating the characteristics of a hunting area to his passenger. During a turn, the plane hit some trees and then crashed."
45842,"was taxiing when the engine stopped. the pilot examined the engine, restarted it and continued to taxi for takeoff. after completing the run-up it took off from runway 33. at an altitude of approximately 500 feet the engine backfired and stopped. while attempting to return to runway 15 and to avoid construction the pilot began a left turn. according to witnesses the aircraft pitched down shortly after starting the turn and struck the ground at a steep nose-down angle. the investigation revealed that the main fuel filter and carburetor contained water, sand and rust."
45841,"The engine stopped shortly after the pilot took off from a small lake. Not having enough distance to land straight ahead, the pilot made a 180 degree turn. During the turn, the float and the right wingtip struck the water and the aircraft flipped over and sank."
45834,pilot initiated a takeoff roll from the center to the north of the lake. the plane rose into the air at a low speed but fell back into the water before gaining altitude. instead of climbing back up through a passage at the end of the lake the pilot made a downwind turn at low speed toward a 400-foot hill. the plane crashed near the top of the hill.
45833,During stall exercises the aircraft entered a flat spin and was unable to recover before hitting the ground.
45830,"After 2 hours and 40 minutes of flight, the engine stopped due to lack of fuel, despite the fact that the pilot had personally refueled the aircraft before the flight. The aircraft was seriously damaged when it fell into a ditch during a forced landing. The fuel gauge indicated that there was still a quarter of the tank remaining."
45822,pilot hovered lower than ideal altitude and the aircraft suffered a power loss followed by an engine fire. the aircraft did not have sufficient altitude to safely autorotate. the cause of the engine failure could not be determined.
45812,After takeoff at about 300 feet the engine failed. Investigation revealed that there was more than a gallon of water in the fuel tank. The pilot had used unfiltered fuel.
45809,During the approach the pilot's attention was diverted and the aircraft landed on the water with the gear down and it overturned.
45806,Weather conditions deteriorated en route and the pilot turned back with the intention of landing at a familiar base. He attempted to land in a narrow channel between the shore and an island. Just before impact on landing the aircraft struck wires and crashed.
45803,The pilot stated that he intended to land on a road to clean his windshield. The aircraft landed hard and the landing gear collapsed.
45797,cruise the engine started to run irregularly and then ran out of fuel. during the forced landing the pilot cleared the chosen landing area and the aircraft hit the high bank of the river.
45793,"The pilot was maneuvering his helicopter around a small pond while checking a float that had just been repaired. The main rotor blades struck the water, causing the aircraft to overturn."
45788,"Following a normal landing, the pilot retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps."
45781,"As it was rolling on landing, the plane left the axis and rolled over onto its back."
45780,"was on a hydrological survey flight as part of a water level study for Hydro Quebec. The pilot had chosen a stationary floating ice bank that seemed suitable for landing. Judging the location to be unsuitable, the pilot switched to a backward translation, but the left float hit the current and the helicopter overturned. The aircraft was not equipped with life jackets."
45779,"Once landed, the aircraft went off its axis. During the turn, one wing touched the water. The pilot then tried to catch his aircraft but the other wing touched the water in turn."
45771,the weather was deteriorating the pilot continued on his way. flying at 1500 feet he could only see the ground intermittently. after an hour of flying the weather improved but the pilot was lost. unable to determine his position he decided to make a precautionary landing in a field. on landing the front wheel sank into a hole and tore off.
45764,final the landing gear being retracted the pilot puts the engines to idle because it is too high. the pilot hears the landing gear warning but takes it for the stall warning. when he puts the throttle back on the warning stops. arriving on the runway he cuts the throttle and the plane lands on its belly.
45763,"being in cruise at 1500 feet the engine failed. the pilot decided to land on a road but landed hard, did a wooden horse and got stuck in a snow bank. the only explanation for the failure is the icing of the carburetor."
45761,"was taxiing downwind when a gust lifted the tail and caused the aircraft to swing to the right. Undergoing excessive lateral forces, the right landing gear broke."
45760,On landing the plane bounced and drifted to the side of the runway where it hit a snow bank.
45756,"Finally the aircraft hit a snow bank, damaging its landing gear. After going around the pilot assessed the situation and decided to land with the gear retracted next to the runway."
45751,had landed in a remote area during training and the pilot maintained a sufficient pitch to prevent the skids from sinking into the deep snow. The pilot leaned over to check through the left door whether the tail rotor was clear. The helicopter began to roll to the right and the pilot was unable to correct the manoeuvre in time and the aircraft rolled onto its side.
45749,"During the flight the weather conditions deteriorated as expected, turning into snow and snow flurries; the pilot then decided to land and wait for the weather to improve. The landing went well but the aircraft was damaged when it hit a hillock on the edge of the shore."
45744,that the aircraft was in cruise mode the engine began to malfunction. the pilot checked the instruments in vain and decided to head for the victoriaville airport. the engine failed 2 miles before reaching the airport and the aircraft landed in the snow near the runway threshold then swerved into a snow bank.
45741,"The pilot made a precautionary landing on a narrow road because the engine was not running properly. After checking the engine, he decided to take off. While traveling at 30 mph, the left wheel entered the soft shoulder and the aircraft swerved, hit a snowdrift and then overturned."
45739,"tailwind of the approach the student pilot decided to switch tanks from the right to the left. shortly after the engine stopped. he attempted a forced landing in a snowy wasteland and the nose gear failed on impact. the student pilot inadvertently selected the \off\"" position and the engine ran out of fuel."

95856,"The pilot of the PA-18 took off from Runway 24R and then turned right to hook a 26-foot by 36-foot advertising banner that was lying at the intersection of Taxiways Charlie and Mike. After hooking the banner, the pilot attempted to release it because it had curled up in a gust of wind. The release was not successful because the hook cable had wrapped around the tail wheel. The pilot decided to land straight ahead. The aircraft landed hard north of Runway 24D between Bravo, Charlie, Alpha and Runway 18. The pilot was not injured."
94782,"The Merlin IV took off on October 5 from Dorval bound for Edmunston (CYES). During the flight, wind shear and severe turbulence were reported. Just before landing at Edmunston, the captain had to take over flight controls from the co-pilot due to wind shear. The pilot reported a firm landing but nothing more. On the ground, the crew carried out a detailed inspection of the exterior of the airframe and observed nothing abnormal. The aircraft returned to Dorval the same day and landed without further problems. The next day, during a routine check carried out by the airline's maintenance department, significant damage to the lower part of the engine nacelle was noted."
94465,"the b90 was orbiting at 3,000 feet asl over a forest fire that was raging on the cliff face bordering the st. lawrence river. the passenger a <pointer> from the fire protection society (sopfeu) seated to the right of the pilot asked the latter to fly over the area near the railway line located near the river in order to assess the threat to rail transportation that the fire could represent. the pilot moved away towards the river and descended to 500 feet asl before following the railway line westward over the water. he intended to make a right turn to allow the passenger to better observe the area. the flaps were retracted and the airspeed was 160 knots. during the turn the pilot judged that there was not enough space between the rising terrain and the aircraft to complete the manoeuvre. After concluding that his room for manoeuvre was sufficiently limited that a U-turn would cause the aircraft to stall during the turn, he decided to attempt to cross the ridge straight ahead. To this end, he applied full throttle and then selected the speed that would allow the best climb gradient. The right wing struck a tree about 400 feet from the summit. The pilot then pitched the aircraft up to reduce the deceleration forces. A fire broke out shortly after the collision with the ground. The pilot had to untie and pull the unconscious passenger from the cabin. The occupants evacuated the aircraft through the main door without further incident. The wind was from the southwest at 15 knots and visibility was over 15 miles. The pilot reported no anomalies or malfunctions."
94145,"The aircraft, a Cessna 152, was on a training flight practicing stall exercises: spiral spins and high-angle bank turns over Lake St. Francis.

The ceiling was approximately 800 feet."
93748,"About 45 minutes from destination on a vfr \""on top\"" flight the cessna 337's front engine misfired and shut down. The pilot attempted to restart the front engine unsuccessfully and then secured the aircraft and feathered the propeller. Shortly thereafter the rear engine shut down and the aircraft began to lose altitude. At about 2,500 feet it broke through the cloud cover, chose a field and landed on its belly. Due to the conditions in the field the pilot elected to land without extending the landing gear. The pilot was uninjured and damage was limited to the outer surface of the belly of the aircraft, a wing tip and the front propeller. The pilot is licensed in the united states for vfr \""on top\"". The aircraft has an endurance of 5 1/2 hours and it had only flown 1:40 hrs since leaving miramichi nb. mechanical inspection has revealed nothing to date. on the ground the tanks were about half full the propellers were turning freely. no contaminants were found when the tanks were drained and fuel flow to the carburetors was not restricted. information to follow.10-jul-98: no obvious cause has been found. both engines were checked and are ok. a contamination check and system flow check were done and nothing was found."""
93696,"the pilot took off from the magog river on a local flight. about 15 minutes after takeoff the wag-aero 2+2's engine stopped while the floatplane was at about 1,300 feet agl over a residential area. the pilot decided to make an emergency landing on dry land after calculating that he could not make it to the river. to avoid a collision with a house and power lines the pilot steered the aircraft into a tree. the right float struck a branch the aircraft spun 180? to the left and fell into the garden of a private home tilted to the left. the left wing struck the ground and the aircraft came to rest on its floats a few inches from a small shed. the pilot injured his head while evacuating the cockpit. when refueling just before the flight the pilot closed the fuel cocks of the two tanks located in the wings. he did not open the cocks before takeoff. the aircraft which is equipped with a 2.5 gallon tank ran out of fuel. the fuel consumption of the engine (lycoming 0320) is 8 gallons per hour."
92527,"The Bell 206 L-4 was hovering at approximately 100 feet AGL at 20 knots when the pilot made a right turn. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter rapidly lost altitude. The pilot had to apply more than the maximum allowable power to arrest the descent. The tail rotor struck the top of a tree before the aircraft could regain altitude. During the climb, the tail rotor failed. The pilot cut the power and successfully autorotated onto a frozen lake."
91473,"The pilot was carrying a longline. After the load was placed on the ground, the Bell 206's main rotor rpm began to decrease. The aircraft struck the ground violently. The oil and fuel will be checked for contaminants. The engine may be sent to the TSB laboratory for testing."
91379,"The student was on a solo cross-country flight from Rouyn with a stopover in Val-d'Or followed by a return to Rouyn. During landing, the nose gear collapsed. According to the student, the landing was normal. The damage was mainly located on the nose gear and the airframe. There was also damage to the propeller. The aircraft was towed and technicians will assess the damage and submit the results."
91163,"The pilot of the amateur-built Sonerai had been flying for approximately 40 minutes when engine problems began. After several attempts to correct the significant loss of power, the pilot reported to the Quebec City Tower that he had to make a forced landing. The pilot landed on Charest Boulevard in Quebec City. During the landing, the aircraft's left wing was damaged. The aircraft was quickly transported off the road. During a visual inspection after the event, the owner discovered that there was a fault in the magneto distributor that caused ignition in the intake line of a cylinder and disconnected the intake line from the gases to the cylinders. The mixture, made too lean by the leak, did not allow the engine to develop normal power."
91139,The student pilot on an ultralight Beaver Spectrum on the fleet had just taken off for a ground flight. During the climb he felt oscillations.

On his third attempt to land the aircraft, the pilot lost all visual references and the aircraft moved towards the edge of the lake at an estimated speed of 20 knots before the propeller struck some trees. The pilot mentioned that the aircraft had slid on the snow for a distance of 150 feet. He also mentioned that the vibrations caused by the aircraft after contact with the trees had been violent and that the 3 rear passengers had been ejected from the aircraft. In addition, his seat and that of the other front passenger had been torn from their anchors. No one was injured."
87606,"The Cessna U206F on floats was docked on rocks along the lake. When the pilot pushed the aircraft to begin taxiing, he noticed that the left float was taking on water and was starting to stall forward. Within seconds, the aircraft pitched down and rolled over. The passenger in the right front seat climbed over the pilot to evacuate the aircraft through the left front door that was ajar. The pilot asked the passenger in the back to evacuate the aircraft through the right cargo door. The latter opened the front cargo door without difficulty since the flaps were retracted. The pilot had time to take out three life jackets before evacuating the aircraft himself. Only the float was damaged. The three people wearing life jackets were able to reach the shore where two of their colleagues were waiting for them. With no flight plan, the search was not undertaken until late in the evening when the pilot's wife alerted the authorities.

No evidence of arcing in the surrounding electrical wiring."
84582,"The rotorway exec helicopter had just taken off when there was a loss of power. The helicopter landed hard. The pilot evacuated the aircraft despite his back injury. The damage to the aircraft is significant. According to the pilot and the person responsible for maintenance, the engine failure was due to the simple ignition system."
84288,the ultralight type challenger ii c-idtz took off from chambly airport for a local flight. the pilot with a cameraman on board was making low-altitude passes to take shots for a film. the pilot initiated a turn at a height of about 100 feet above the ground. during the turn the ultralight lost altitude the pilot tried to bring the aircraft back into straight and level flight but without success. seeing the ground coming he applied full power which reduced the rate of descent and reduced the impact forces with the ground. the pilot suffered serious injuries while the passenger escaped unharmed. the damage to the ultralight is significant. according to the pilot the cameraman who was sitting in the back seat was a tall person. it is possible that during the left turn the latter pressed on the left rudder pedal. The small pilot tried to counter this left yaw movement with the ailerons which resulted in a loss of altitude. The aircraft was already at a very low altitude so there was no safety margin. Even if the pilot applied full power it was impossible for him to correct this loss of altitude which resulted in the impact with the ground.
84257,"Before taking off from Petit Lac Huard, the pilot of the PA-18 purged the aircraft to check for water. Everything seemed normal and the pilot took off towards Lac Bouchette. About 1/2 mile into the initial climb, the engine misfired and the power lost. The pilot had to land straight ahead of him in the forest. He managed to unbuckle his seat belt and evacuate the aircraft before it caught fire. Earlier in the day, while taxiing over Lac Bouchette in preparation for a takeoff towards Petit Lac Huard, the aircraft's engine misfired. The pilot purged the fuel tanks a few times and found water each time. He then let the engine run for about ten minutes. He purged again and found a few drops of water. he took off with two passengers on board towards little lake huard and had no difficulty en route. the aircraft has been annotated (stc) since 1994 for the use of automotive gasoline (mogas). the pilot refuels the aircraft from 5-gallon jerry cans and does not use a 5-micron filter-separator (go-no go filter) which helps reduce the risk of water contamination of the gasoline. refueling from jerry cans must be done with care to avoid any contamination. mogas, which is more volatile, less refined and less compatible with certain synthetic natural rubber or plastic materials, is generally not recommended by engine manufacturers or oil companies. in addition, the probability of carburetor icing is greater when using automotive gasoline. Because of the higher volatility of automotive gasoline compared to aviation gasoline, the margin of safety under conditions that favor the formation of vapor locks is less in the case of automotive gasoline. Also, engine valves often tend to stick."
84019,"The pilot of the Piper Arrow, registration C-GQYI, was making an approach to land. He was convinced that he had lowered the landing gear. On the ground, the aircraft slid gently along the runway until it came to a complete stop. When the aircraft came to a complete stop, the pilot and passengers exited without difficulty.

60503,During a training session the pilot had difficulty with the landing gear lowering system. During a pass over the tower the controller confirmed a partial extension of the wheels. After landing during the ground roll the aircraft collapsed and went off the runway.
54302,"During the final approach, the cockpit indicated that the landing gear was down and locked. After the landing roll, the right main gear collapsed as the aircraft was turning left onto the taxiway. The investigation determined that the landing gear collapse was caused by the lack of tension on the geometric locking strut. The right landing gear truss rubbed against the lower wing spar flange, preventing the pretension from providing geometric locking. When the aircraft turned left, the weight was laterally on the right main gear, which folded inward. the system operates by direct engagement of a connecting rod between the control lever and the landing gear and it is the position of the control lever which informs the pilot of the position of the landing gear and not that of the geometric locking mechanism. for the pilot all the indications were normal whereas in reality the landing gear was extended but not locked. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the landing gear collapsed because the geometric locking mechanism did not lock properly. 2. the geometric locking mechanism did not engage because the friction of the landing gear retraction lattice hindered its extension. 3. in the cockpit the indications relating to the landing gear derive from the position of the landing gear control lever and not from the position of the geometric locking point. other established facts: -none-"
54295,"took off after flying 3,000 feet. at a height of 290 feet the engine suddenly lost power. the pilot was unable to re-establish climb power. the remaining power was insufficient to maintain level flight the pilot attempted a forced landing in a plowed field. during the landing roll the landing gear was torn off and the aircraft came to rest on its belly. the investigation revealed that the pilot had bled the fuel system without the aid of a test tube so that he could not determine whether or not the fuel contained water. the temperature was minus two degrees Celsius and the dew point minus nine degrees Celsius which gave only a low probability of carburetor icing. on impact the fuel filter was torn from its mounting points and it was emptied. It was therefore not possible to analyse its contents, in particular to determine the presence of water or ice. The aircraft had spent the night outside with the tanks half full. In the morning there was ice on the aircraft. After the accident, ground tests showed that the engine was operating normally. During the investigation it was also discovered that part of the central tube of the exhaust silencer had been missing for some time. Laboratory examination revealed that the rupture that had occurred in the silencer had not restricted the evacuation of exhaust gases during the flight in question. Condensation in the half-full tanks caused water to settle in the fuel system. Due to the drop in temperature below freezing during the previous night, ice crystals were able to form in the fuel system and reduce the flow rate. however the investigation has insufficient evidence to confirm this hypothesis. this investigation resulted in the following laboratory report: lp 405/84 - examination of muffler. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. during the initial climb after take-off the engine suffered a sudden drop in speed, the cause of which is undetermined. 2. the remaining power being insufficient to ensure level flight the pilot attempted a forced landing in a ploughed field. on landing the landing gear was torn off. other established facts: 1. the method used to purge the fuel before take-off did not allow the pilot to determine the condition of the fuel. 2. part of the central tube of the muffler had broken off some time before but this breakage could not have caused the restriction of the exhaust gases during the flight in question."
54290,"4:45 a.m. the pilot and passenger boarded the aircraft for a local night flight. the pilot and passenger first consumed an alcoholic beverage that they had brought on board and then the pilot took off from runway 27. after a few turns over the city of gatineau the aircraft turned towards the southeast and then towards the northeast where the terrain is higher than in the immediate vicinity of the airport. the aircraft then entered a layer of clouds. the pilot began a descent to try to re-establish visual contact with the ground. suddenly the aircraft struck the tops of several trees and the windshield shattered. a few seconds later the aircraft struck other trees and came to rest on its back in a maple grove. the pilot was seriously injured; the uninjured passenger went to seek help on foot. the inverted attitude of the aircraft at the time of impact indicates that the pilot had lost control of the aircraft. the pilot did not hold a private pilot licence. his student pilot permit only authorized him to conduct solo flights under the supervision of an instructor. the 6 a.m. weather report issued by the gatineau flight service station (fss) indicated an overcast sky with a ceiling of 400 feet, visibility of one mile, light mist, fog and light winds. several witnesses observed mist in the area of ​​the crash shortly after it occurred. to fly in clouds a pilot must hold an instrument rating and must have received authorization from air traffic control to conduct the flight under instrument flight rules (ifr). the student pilot did not hold an instrument rating and did not receive an ifr clearance. at the time of takeoff, flight information service at gatineau airport was provided by the montreal fss on the gatineau fss frequency. the student pilot did not call on the gatineau fss frequency. police officers arriving at the scene noted that the student pilot's breath gave off a strong odor of alcohol. at the time of the accident, current legislation did not allow authorities to subject an aircraft pilot injured in an accident to a breathalyzer test. section 409(a) of the air regulations specifies that no person may act as a crew member on board an aircraft for eight hours after ingesting an alcoholic beverage. This student pilot, who did not hold a licence or qualification for night flight or instrument flight, encountered instrument weather conditions at night. After entering clouds, the student pilot attempted a descent and became disoriented. He lost control of the aircraft, which struck trees and crashed. Findings Established facts relating to the causes: 1. The pilot encountered instrument weather conditions at night when he did not hold a private pilot licence, a night flight qualification or an instrument flight qualification. 2. Being in instrument weather conditions, the pilot lost control of the aircraft. Other established facts: 1. The pilot consumed an alcoholic beverage before the flight; Air Regulation 409(a) states that no person shall act as a crew member on board an aircraft for eight hours after consuming an alcoholic beverage."
54278,flew over the village the pilot had the impression that the wind was calm and he did not check if it was the same at the nearby aerodrome where he was to land. he decided to land on runway 31 because he felt that the slope of the runway would help him slow down more quickly after touchdown. shortly after touching down he lost directional control and the aircraft left the runway and entered a ditch. it was later determined that the wind was not calm at the time of landing. in reality the aircraft landed with a strong wind from the three-quarters behind blowing in gusts. during landing during deceleration the aircraft began to weathervane in the wind. the pilot's corrections were not effective in keeping the aircraft on the runway. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot thought there was no wind on landing. 2. the pilot landed into a three-quarter aft crosswind. 3. the control correction was not effective enough to maintain directional control of the aircraft. 4. the aircraft entered a ditch when leaving the runway. other established facts: -none-
54276,"a safe landing on dirt runway number 24 at a private airfield the pilot with one passenger on board went back up runway 24 to take off again. the wind was blowing from 195 degrees magnetic at 15 miles per hour with gusts to 20 miles per hour but the pilot applied the throttle and raised the tail of the aircraft to climb the runway on two wheels. when he reduced the throttle to lower the tail the aircraft began to do a wood horse to the right. the pilot corrected with the brakes and rudder pedals but the aircraft left the runway to the right. the main landing gear dug into the soft soil of a plowed field and the aircraft flipped over. the pilot taxied at high speed with the tail of the aircraft in the air while the wind was three-quarters aft from the right. when he reduced the throttle to lower the tail he lost directional control and the aircraft veered to the right and left the runway. because of the high speed the pilot was unable to stop before the wheels entered the ploughed field. with such wind the usual technique is to taxi slowly with the tail on the ground while maintaining directional control with the rudder pedals, ailerons and brakes. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the aircraft was taxiing with a fairly strong three-quarter tailwind. 2. the pilot lost directional control by taxiing at excessive speed with a tailwind. other findings: 1. the pilot had hardly flown in the last 90 days."
54258,"The flight to a fishing camp had been planned for a week. The pilot was very familiar with the route, which flew over a mountainous region. The departure scheduled for 08:00 had to be delayed because the weather conditions were below the minimum according to the visual flight rules (VFR). At 09:30 the pilot asked the operator of the nearby airport for a weather report. He was informed that on the route he had planned the ceilings were low with reduced visibility and that cumulonimbus (thunderstorms) were forecast for his destination during the afternoon. At 10:30 the pilot decided to take off, planning to use Loran C as a means of navigation. He floated on the lake and after taking on three passengers took off. the cloud base was 2,000 feet above sea level (asl) and the mountain peaks were hanging over his route. to stay out of the clouds the pilot flew into a valley. fifteen minutes after takeoff the aircraft entered low stratus and the pilot attempted to turn back. while making a 108 degree turn in the clouds the aircraft struck the side of a mountain at 2,700 feet above sea level. although the weather conditions had not improved significantly on his route the pilot decided to take off anyway as thunderstorms were forecast for his destination that afternoon. as he was very familiar with the route and the terrain he felt he could use loran c to navigate and was confident he would be able to reach his destination in this way. when entering low stratus the pilot attempted to return to visual flight by making a 180 degree turn. there was insufficient room to manoeuvre to make the turn and the aircraft crashed into the side of a mountain. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the vfr flight was attempted in poor weather conditions. 2. the pilot continued in vfr despite increasingly poor weather conditions. 3. the pilot lost visual contact with the ground and the aircraft crashed into the side of a mountain. other established facts: -none-"
54255,"which had a high gross weight was on final approach for landing and was heading towards a suitable landing area when at approximately 75 feet above ground level one of the passengers suggested to the pilot that they land a little further away. as the pilot was manoeuvring towards the new location he noticed a drop in rotor rpm of the helicopter. he decreased collective pitch while attempting to apply full power. the engine did not respond fully and the pilot was unable to reduce the rate of descent. the helicopter landed hard, slid forward, banked slightly to the right and nose down then rolled to the left side. the engine (lycoming h10-360-dia) was disassembled and sent to a major engine overhaul shop for a bench test. before starting it a fuel leak was noted near the governor. after start the leak was quickly located; it originated from a chafing hole in the fuel injector feed pipe for cylinder no. 4. the metal earthing braid on the right hand side of the engine was found to be showing signs of wear; it had rubbed on the fuel line causing the fuel line to chafe. on this particular model of helicopter and when it has a high gross weight takeoffs and landings must be carried out at maximum engine power. the fuel leak was preventing cylinder no. 4 from delivering its maximum power. when the pilot applied full engine power in an attempt to land further away the engine did not respond. according to the engine logbook the governor had been fitted 179 hours previously. as the governor is located in a fairly difficult to access location there may not have been enough clearance between the line and the earthing braid which caused the wear. This investigation resulted in laboratory report number LP 262/84 and conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the fuel injector feed pipe for cylinder No. 4 was perforated by wear because it was mounted too close to the metal earthing braid on the right side of the engine. 2. the engine could not deliver its maximum power due to the fuel feed pipe leak. 3. the hard landing was a consequence of the lack of maximum power during the approach preceding landing. other established facts: -none-"
54249,"had just taken off towards the west of a deep lake. at about 500 feet the engine misfired. the pilot reduced the throttle, pulled the carburetor reheat lever, put the aircraft in a descent and extended the flaps 40 degrees in order to land the seaplane straight ahead on the lake. seeing the waterfalls of the cliffs at the end of the lake approaching, the pilot opened the throttle wide and the engine resumed normally. almost simultaneously the pilot ordered a steep left turn. during the turn the aircraft nose-dived and spun in the air and crashed into the waters of the lake. the three seriously injured occupants were rescued by boaters. analysis of the damage sustained by the aircraft and witness statements indicate that the aircraft struck the surface of the lake in a left spin. according to the pilot, a U-turn was necessary to avoid the cliffs at the end of the lake. No mechanical defects that may have existed prior to the accident were noted during the investigation. At the time of the accident, the temperature was 27 degrees Celsius, the relative humidity was high, and a light wind was blowing from the west. For an unknown reason, the engine misfired. It is possible that the carburetor had iced up. Concerned about the misfire, the pilot closed the throttle to land the aircraft on the lake again. As he approached the end of the lake and saw the waterfalls, the pilot feared he would hit the cliffs and began a 180-degree turn in an attempt to land in the opposite direction. Because of the steep bank angle, the aircraft stalled and entered a spin; the altitude was then insufficient for the pilot to recover from the spin. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. concerned because of the engine misfires that occurred after takeoff, the pilot tried to land the seaplane straight ahead on the lake. 2. because he was afraid of hitting the cliffs at the end of the lake, the pilot initiated a steep left turn. 3. during the turn, the seaplane entered a spin. other established facts: -none-"
54248,"that he was towing an advertising poster at low altitude over the saguenay river the helicopter struck a power line and crashed into the river. the pilot got out of the wreckage and swam back to shore. the poster was intended for a convoy of cars that were part of a wedding. the pilot did not concentrate on the obstacles in front of him because of the 360-degree turns he had to make to match the speed of his aircraft to that of the convoy. in addition, he had to ensure that his sign remained properly deployed during the turns. although the pilot saw the power line when he made his turn, he did not have enough time to avoid it. the pilot was deliberately flying at low altitude so that the towed sign would be easy to read. when he prepared his flight, however, he did not check for obstacles in the path. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the aircraft towing an advertising poster was flying at too low an altitude. 2. the pilot had not checked for obstacles in his flight path. 3. the pilot was unable to avoid an electrical wire crossing the river because he was concentrating on the convoy of cars forming part of a wedding and on the poster he was towing. other established facts: -none-"
54240,"The purpose of the flight was to estimate the surface wind regime at low altitude before spraying. The pilot had not planned a particular route because his passenger-observer was to show him the spraying areas in flight. After 35 minutes of flight, the observer asked the pilot to head into a valley. The pilot changed direction but quickly realized that the aircraft would not be able to cross the mountain that blocked the valley. Since the narrowness of the valley did not allow him to make a 180-degree turn, the pilot applied full power to cross the mountain. About 350 feet from the summit, the pilot deliberately stalled the aircraft in the trees. The pilot had not planned his flight because he had to follow the instructions of his observer. He therefore did not know the type of terrain he was going to fly over. even at full power the climb performance of his aircraft was inferior to the slope of the terrain. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot did not prepare his low-altitude flight sufficiently. 2. the pilot, at the request of his observer, entered a dead-end valley. 3. when the pilot realized that he could not clear the terrain he deliberately stalled his aircraft in the trees. other established facts: -none-"
54238,"was on final approach at 100 feet above ground level when the left wing suddenly dropped. the pilot lowered the nose, increased power, applied aileron and rudder pedals to the opposite side, but was unable to regain control of the aircraft. the aircraft struck the ground almost vertically 150 feet short of the intended landing area. the pilot was seriously injured. the pilot stated that the final speed was 55 mph, which is well above the normal stall speed. he also stated that the wind was blowing steadily at 10 mph and played no role. the investigation was unable to determine why the pilot lost control of the aircraft. findings findings relating to causes: 1. the pilot lost control of the aircraft for undetermined reasons. other findings: -nil-"
54217,"The purpose of the flight was to improve the student pilot's navigation skills. The aircraft carried 3 hours and 15 minutes of fuel. The instructor and the student pilot had planned to fly to Mont-Laurier Airport, located 100 miles away, to fly circuits and return to Sainte-Therese. Before departure, they had not inquired about the condition of the Mont-Laurier runway. When they arrived near Mont-Laurier, they were unable to find the airport and spent 30 minutes looking for it. When the instructor could not find it, he decided to return to Sainte-Therese Airport. Shortly after leaving the Mont-Laurier area, the two pilots noticed that the fuel gauges indicated that there was only a quarter of fuel left in the tanks. The instructor then decided to make a precautionary landing on an asphalt road. After finding a suitable segment of route, the pilots made three reconnaissance passes and the instructor flew the approach with full flaps. During the final descent, a power line that crossed the approach path was seen and avoided. However, other wires that crossed the route at a 45-degree angle were seen too late. The aircraft struck them and fell to the ground. The investigation revealed that there was less than an hour of fuel left in the tanks at the time of the accident. The runways at Mont-Laurier airport were covered in snow and unusable. The pilots did not check the condition of the airport before departure. After searching for Mont-Laurier airport, the amount of fuel remaining made it uncertain whether to return to Ste-Therese or divert to a suitable aerodrome. it is likely that the pilots were then forced to make a precautionary landing. the pilots believed that there were no more obstacles in their path; when they saw the other wires it was too late to avoid them. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. in their preparation for the flight the pilots failed to inquire about the status of the destination airport. 2. after the pilots had searched for the destination airport the quantity of fuel remaining made the return flight uncertain. 3. during the precautionary landing on a route wires were seen too late to be avoided. other established facts: -none-"
54214,"pilot towing an advertising banner was returning to his departure aerodrome. he reported his position to the control tower, which cleared him to descend for an approach on runway 06 left. about 3 miles west of the aerodrome the engine stopped. the pilot issued a mayday and headed for a vacant field. he released the banner at about 450 feet agl. the drag reduction reduced the aircraft's rate of descent, making it too high to land on the chosen field. the pilot concluded that there was no other suitable landing site and elected to land at the exit of a descending left turn. the aircraft landed heavily and stopped in about 35 feet. The hard landing damaged the right landing gear, both wingtips, the propeller, the lower engine cowling and the rear fuselage. Examination of the fuel system determined that the aircraft had run out of fuel. The pilot underestimated the fuel consumption incurred while towing the banner and did not monitor fuel consumption adequately. Findings Facts Established Relating to Causes: 1. Fuel consumption for towing the banner was underestimated. 2. The pilot did not monitor fuel consumption. 3. The engine ran out of fuel. Other Facts Established: -Nil-"
54207,"During a wildlife survey flight, the pilot decided to land his aircraft on skis on a snowy forest path with very little room for the wings. He landed slightly to the left of the axis and after covering a short distance, the left wing hit a shrub. It hit others so that the aircraft began to pivot to the left. The pilot therefore decided to go around again. As soon as he applied full throttle and pulled back on the stick, the right ski hit a snowy mound. The pitch then changed abruptly. It appears that the tail hit the mound and suffered significant damage that worsened when the left horizontal stabilizer hit a shrub. The aircraft climbed until it crashed into the forest and overturned."
53451,"During a high speed taxi test the pilot realized that he did not have enough space to stop and took off. The initial climb appeared normal, but at about 50 feet the climb rate suddenly decreased. Unable to continue the climb the pilot decided to make a forced landing in some tall trees. The decrease in climb rate is thought to have been caused by downdrafts. The taxi was intended to familiarize the pilot with the aircraft as he had never flown this type of aircraft before."
53450,Witnesses saw the aircraft begin a left turn and then begin a spiral descent. The speed increased and both wings broke off. A check of the flight control system revealed that the forward part of the control rod mounted under the control column was not screwed in. The control rod would have clearly come loose in flight and caused the loss of elevator control.
53315,when starting the pilot used too rich a mixture and a fire broke out in the engine compartment. instead of cutting off the fuel supply the pilot continued the start. as the fire intensified the pilot and his passenger evacuated the aircraft without carrying out the checklist. the fire was brought under control using a portable fire extinguisher but some parts of the engine were damaged.
53308,"During a training session, the crew was doing autorotation exercises. After doing about ten autorotations with engine recovery, the pilot decided to do an autorotation with the engine off until landing. The pilot maintained the speed at 70 mph during the descent, but wanting to increase the glide distance, he reduced the main rotor rpm to the minimum allowable. He began his flare at 50 ft from the ground. The helicopter landed slightly nose up, the rear of the skids first. The aircraft bounced and landed hard in a slight nose down attitude. The main rotor blades clipped the tail boom. The low rotor rpm, the hard landing, and possibly a rearward movement of the control column as the helicopter touched down in a nose down attitude caused the rotor blades to flap and contact the tail boom."
53306,having positioned himself to make a straight-in approach on final the pilot did not consult his checklist. during the approach he continued his conversation with his passenger and near the runway he heard the sound of a horn which he took for the stall warning. at the last moment he realized that it was rather the landing gear warning. he therefore carried out the landing gear extension maneuver but it was already too late to prevent the aircraft from landing on its belly.
53305,"During a local flight the passenger said he felt unwell. The pilot decided not to return to his departure airport but instead to land on a gravel road. The wind was calm but during the taxi after landing the pilot suddenly felt that he no longer had control of the aircraft. The aircraft entered a ditch that bordered the left side of the road. After the accident the pilot examined his aircraft and noticed that the left return spring of the tail wheel had disappeared. It is very likely that the left return spring of the tail wheel broke during the landing and this breakage reduced control in the left direction. However, corrections to the right were still possible. The pilot overcorrected with the rudder pedals and brakes and the aircraft entered a ditch that bordered the left side of the road. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. it is highly probable that the left return spring of the tail wheel broke during landing on a gravel road. 2. the pilot lost directional control of the aircraft due to the loss of the left return spring of the tail wheel. 3. the aircraft entered a ditch. other established facts: -none-"
53300,"It was early in the morning, there were fog banks on the lake and the pilot had to delay his landing while waiting for the fog to clear a little. He decided to land using the technique of landing on mirrored water, although the fog still limited visibility. On touchdown, the aircraft suddenly rolled and the pilot was unable to maintain directional control. The right float sank, the right wing tip hit the water and the aircraft spun. Despite the significant damage it sustained, the aircraft remained on its floats and the pilot was able to make it to shore. After the accident, the pilot noticed that one of the profiled shrouds located between the floats had become detached at one end. The pilot had no recent experience of landings on mirrored water. The damage sustained by the aircraft was consistent with damage caused by a hard landing and the manoeuvre resulted in a loss of control and a tailspin. The struts were detached as a result of the fracture of the left front mounting bracket of the profiled strut. Laboratory examination revealed that the mounting bracket had broken under the effect of overload. There was no indication that this fracture existed before the accident. Rather, it was the result of lateral forces exerted on the floats during the tailspin. Further examination of the bracket revealed that the mechanical characteristics of the equipment were well below the standards set by the manufacturer. Furthermore, the bracket was not identified as being an approved part from the manufacturer. (note: the investigation resulted in expert report no. lp 59/84). findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. visibility was limited by fog when landing on a mirror-like body of water. 2. the pilot made a hard landing and lost directional control. other established facts: 1. the lateral force exerted on the floats during the tail-over caused the shroud attachment fitting to break. 2. the fitting was not a manufacturer-approved part. 3. the mechanical characteristics of the fitting were well below the standards set by the manufacturer."
53297,"The pilot lowered the landing gear to prevent the aircraft from drifting while he was busy on the radio. He then applied the throttle while retracting the landing gear to taxi to another location on the lake. While taxiing on the step, the pilot felt the nose dip and the aircraft lurched violently to the left toward the shore: the aircraft was seriously damaged after hitting submerged stumps. Subsequent examination revealed that the ball joint on the end of the left nose gear door link had fractured under overload, which explained the aircraft lurching to the left."
53294,on floats took off prematurely after bouncing on a two-foot-high swell crest. the speed was too low and the aircraft fell back into the water. the touchdown damaged the floats. during the takeoff attempt the swell was too high for the manoeuvre to be carried out safely. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot attempted to take off in a two-foot-high swell. 2. at the time of the premature takeoff the speed was insufficient to ensure the aircraft's lift. other established facts: -nil-
53293,"During the landing on a small section of forest road the left wing of the aircraft hit some small trees, the plane veered sharply to the left and plunged into a large ditch."
53288,"The pilot had decided to land long to reduce taxi time. During the flare, the aircraft drifted to the left side of the runway and the left wing struck a beacon located 98 ft from the edge of the runway. The lower surface of the left wing, the flaps and the pitot tube were damaged. The pilot brought the aircraft back to the runway and taxied to the parking area. It was not possible to explain why the aircraft had drifted to the left."
53287,"The pilot, owner and builder of the helicopter took off on a local flight. Shortly thereafter, witnesses saw the aircraft over the shore of a lake at an altitude of approximately 200 feet. The Scorpion had just begun a left turn when a loud explosion was heard accompanied by black smoke coming from the engine compartment. The helicopter descended rapidly in a 180-degree turn and struck the surface of the lake in a slight dive. The helicopter sank in 10 feet of water. The pilot builder had purchased the aircraft and was to assemble it himself from a company in Phoenix, Arizona that also provided flight instruction. The pilot had completed 19 hours of training with the seller and was limited to the following maneuvers: hovering in ground effect and translational flight at a maximum altitude of 35 feet agl. Due to his lack of autorotation skills, he was prohibited from flying at a higher altitude. Such authorizations and restrictions are only valid for flights in the United States. Air Navigation Orders Series II No. 3, which specify the conditions under which flight permits are issued, do not provide for the issuance of such permits for helicopters built by the purchaser. The aircraft was therefore operated without a flight permit or certificate of registration. At the time of impact, the rotor was no longer rotating. Technical inspection revealed that the lower engine mount was bent downward approximately 1/2 inch and that the upper extension collar was tilted forward, which caused the pulley to back out and released the tension on the belts, resulting in a loss of transmission to the rotor, causing the engine to suddenly race with a smoke noise and a rapid loss of rotor rpm. there is no evidence that the rotor was rotating at the time of impact. this lack of rotations combined with the nose-down attitude confirms that there was no autorotation during the descent. before the accident the skids had been bent during a hard landing. it is very likely that the deformation of the lower engine support came from the. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the movement of the engine caused the deterioration of the belt drive leading to the loss of rotor speed. 2. the manufacturer-pilot did not initiate an autorotation. other established facts: 1. the private construction of a helicopter is not permitted in canada this aircraft was operated without a flight permit or certificate of registration."
53279,"landing gear did not retract after takeoff. when the pilot put the lever in the extended position everything seemed to be in order; he therefore chose to land at the departure aerodrome. as he gently brought the nose gear onto the runway the pilot noticed that the nose of the aircraft was tilted too much; he tried to raise it but the aircraft came to a stop on its nose in a skid. before turning off the battery switch the pilot saw that the three green lights on the landing gear were still on. there was a break in the ball joint that connects the jack to the nose gear strut. on this type of aircraft the position warning contact is mounted at the end of the jack barrel. consequently the green light comes on when the jack piston is completely extended regardless of the position of the landing gear. If the jack separates from the strut, the indicator light still indicates to the pilot that the front axle is extended and locked."
53265,having circled the lake to see where the wind was coming from the pilot decided to land with 60 degrees of left crosswind in order to use the lake in its greatest length. after landing he was unable to stop in time and the left wing hit trees on the shore at the far end of the lake. the pilot stated that there was a wind shift and that he landed downwind.
53262,was on a return flight to base through a valley in bad weather. The pilot attempted to turn around and during the turn the left wing struck some trees. The Norseman disintegrated. It is possible that the pilot was in a hurry to get home as other company aircraft had just completed flights in the area. Fatigue may also have been a factor as the pilot had flown in bad weather for three weeks. The seriousness of the injuries sustained by the occupants may be explained by the fact that the cargo was not secured.
53257,"pilot took off from the lake to make a test flight. he had attached his home-built boat to the mast of the left float. although the plane was certified to carry a canoe, this rowing boat had a flat bottom and a clean-cut stern and bow. in addition, the pilot had secured his boat in such a way that the center of gravity of the plane was at the forward limit; to restore balance, the trim tab was practically in full nose-up position. after takeoff, the plane traveled about a hundred miles above the lake. arriving near the shore, the plane climbed, banked to the right and then skidded to the left during the skid, the wing and the right float hit the surface of the lake. it would seem that the pilot was unable to maintain control of his aircraft because of the load."
53249,landing on a lake covered with thick snow the aircraft capsized. the investigation revealed that the ski sank into the snow because the tip was loaded with wet snow from the previous takeoff.
53236,pilot landed on a frozen lake covered with snow. he stated that he tried to turn while his speed was still high and that when the aircraft did not respond to this request he increased the engine speed. the aircraft skidded and the right ski hit a snow-covered ice bank. the ski stirrup broke and the right wing and propeller hit the ground.
53234,"The pilot, who was returning to his base, had to make an unscheduled overnight stop because of bad weather. The next morning he called his airline to advise that the conditions were still bad. The airline reported good weather at his destination but left him free to decide whether or not to fly. Shortly thereafter the pilot took off. About five minutes after takeoff the aircraft crashed. A witness who was less than a mile from the accident site saw the aircraft flying at an altitude of about 100 feet. This witness stated that he could barely see the aircraft because of heavy snowfall. The weather report from a nearby weather station indicated a ceiling of 800 feet and visibility of 3 to 6 miles in light snow. A ceiling of 400 feet with visibility of 1/2 mile to 3 miles was forecast. It is not known whether the pilot contacted the station before his departure."
52351,failing to start the aircraft engine using the starter the pilot applied the parking brake and started the propeller by hand. the engine started but as the pilot was walking towards the cabin the aircraft started to roll and then accelerated rapidly. could not board the pilot had just enough time to push the tail of the aircraft to swerve it so that it would not hit another aircraft that was facing it. the propeller hit the wingtip of the parked aircraft then the aircraft hit a truck and finally came to rest against two other aircraft. the aircraft was examined and it was found that the brakes were not in good condition.
52348,final approach the pilot extended the landing gear but the left landing gear remained retracted. after several unsuccessful attempts to extend the landing gear using emergency methods the pilot landed on the right landing gear and the nose wheel. technical examination showed that the outer wheel had failed in overload after being weakened by the propagation of a fatigue crack. the crack had propagated under conditions of relatively low stress but relatively high frequencies. the material did not show any significant deficiency that could have caused the failure (lp 414/82).
52344,during an ifr flight the pilot did not have enough fuel to reach his destination and landed at an intermediate airport to refuel. during the descent the rear engine stopped the right main tank was dry. the pilot switched to the auxiliary tank and restarted the engine for landing. the gauge on the left main tank which feeds the front engine indicated that the tank was three-quarters empty. after landing 10 imperial gallons were added to each of the two auxiliary tanks sufficient quantity to continue the flight. ready to go the pilot selected the main tanks. he was able to start the front engine but not the rear engine. he then left his aircraft to make a few phone calls while leaving the engine running. on returning to the aircraft he remained parked for about twenty minutes before heading to the runway. it was not possible to determine if the rear engine was working. Witnesses noted that the take-off run was extremely long and that the climb was at a very low gradient; after losing sight of the aircraft they heard it crash. The technical examination on site revealed that both propellers were at low pitch and were not rotating before impact. The two fuel selectors were located on the main tanks and each of these tanks contained less than a quarter of a litre of petrol. Everything indicates that the take-off was carried out using only the front engine which then stopped when there was no more fuel in the left main tank. Both engines were tested on the bench; they started and ran without difficulty. No engine damage was detected.
52343,"The pilot stated that after the long landing he lost directional control as the aircraft moved from the gravel to the hard surface of the runway. The Cessna swerved to the right before coming to rest in a ditch at the edge of the runway. The propeller, engine, wings and landing gear attachment points were damaged."
52340,having replaced the floats of his beaver with wheels the pilot took off from an extremely short and narrow strip with obstacles on both sides. just after takeoff the left wing struck a tree and the aircraft lurched to the left. the left wing then tore off after hitting a pole. the aircraft rolled abruptly and crashed into the river at the end of the runway.
52329,taxiing the left main landing gear collapsed. technical examination of the landing gear ball joint showed that the landing gear actuator piston had broken due to abnormal overload. the landing gear lock did not fall into place and the entire weight of the aircraft on landing was supported by the landing gear actuator piston. it could not be determined why the landing gear was not locked.
52323,"lost power in cruise flight. the pilot chose a narrow bush path to land and began the approach without autorotating. during the descent the main rotor rpm dropped and the landing was rough. technical inspection of the engine components did not reveal anything abnormal that could explain the loss of rpm. fuel samples taken contained a high proportion of liquid pollutants. there is, however, insufficient evidence to hold pollution responsible for the fuel flow interruption. (lp 310/82)"
52321,"which had just taken off was about 15 feet high when the right wing went down. The pilot was unable to correct the situation, he shut down the engine and landed on water. The right wing hit the water and the plane did a wood-horse."
52317,Taking off from a lake the aircraft struck a submerged rock which damaged the forward compartments of the right float. The pilot was familiar with the lake and should have known the location of the reefs and areas usable for takeoff.
52306,pilot conducted a test flight to evaluate the performance of a newly installed wooden hoffman propeller. during the flight the propeller and upper fairing tore off with a loud explosion. the pilot made a forced landing in glide flight during which the aircraft flipped over. the technical investigation showed that the six propeller mounting bolts had failed as a result of low-frequency fatigue stresses. everything seems to indicate that they were all overtightened during assembly because they had reached the bottom of the thread. subjected to abnormally high loads the bolts failed.
52303,"The pilot was attempting to land in a crosswind that he knew was close to the maximum limits of his aircraft. On approach, he felt turbulence but continued his landing manoeuvre. While taxiing, he was unable to maintain control of the aircraft and rolled left before coming to a stop in a ditch. The pilot had very few flying hours and had not received any dual-control training for almost three years."
52296,"The pilot made his approach to a small lake at 80 knots and landed at 70 knots (higher than normal speed). The aircraft bounced about 20 feet and the pilot applied power to abort the landing. Realizing that he would not be able to clear the trees at the end of the lake, he made a steep turn to the left. The aircraft stalled and struck the lake inverted. The pilot had only 35 hours of float-powered flight experience and did not correctly assess the landing area."
52293,"on takeoff the pilot operated the landing gear lever; it unlocked but did not retract. the pilot tried several times to lock the landing gear using normal and manual methods; without success. on landing the landing gear folded the aircraft lurched and left the runway. technical examination showed that the landing gear motor had torn from its mounting points and that the two main landing gear operating rods were bent. laboratory analysis showed that the worm gear and its gear were jammed together. wear of the teeth caused the worm gear and gear to become mismatched to the point of causing the meshing parts to jam. wear, probably the result of lack of maintenance, spread over a long period."
52276,"During a cruise flight the windshield became covered with oil, forcing the pilot to land on a narrow road. During landing the right wing hit a snow bank and the aircraft pivoted to the right. According to the airline's mechanics, the crankcase ventilation hole was blocked by ice, so that excess pressure inside the crankcase forced the front crankshaft seal out of its housing, causing the oil to leak."
52271,pilot and instructor were practicing a forced landing followed by a complete stop on an icy snow-covered runway. the aircraft touched down 300 feet after the runway threshold; the student victim of the whiteout lost his sense of direction and let the aircraft drift to the left; the left wheel hit a snow bank on the side of the runway. the instructor took over the controls when the aircraft began to lurch to the left and he tried to correct with the right rudder pedal. his efforts were in vain and the aircraft came to a stop in the snow bank.
52269,On the same day the young pilot had been refused permission to fly two or three times because of the very cold weather. He insisted and was allowed to make a local flight on a company aircraft that had just landed at 14:50. The pilot took off at 15:00 with a friend. About 12 minutes later witnesses noticed the aircraft at very low altitude which shortly afterwards began a tight left turn. The witnesses heard the engine speed increase and at almost the same time the left wing struck some power cables. The aircraft crashed in a steep nose-down attitude onto the left wing. Technical examination of the wreckage and aircraft logbooks revealed no evidence of mechanical damage.
51382,During an aerobatics session the aircraft was in a nose-up and tight turn when the engine stopped due to fuel starvation. The pilot tried to restart the engine using the starter but was unsuccessful because the electrical power supply circuit had an intermittent failure. The pilot then decided to make a forced landing on a road. He turned to the left but was unable to straighten out quickly enough. The left wing struck the left edge of the road. The aircraft flew through a rough area and finally came to a stop in a ditch after skidding 180 degrees.
51373,The pilot had only a few hours of flight time and had not flown for two months. He went to do a training flight for landings and takeoffs. During the first landing the aircraft bounced. The pilot tried to counter the bounce and the aircraft bounced a second time. During the third bounce the nose wheel disappeared.
51372,from a dual control navigation exercise the instructor following an engine failure due to oil loss took control and made a forced landing in a plowed field using only 10 degrees of flaps. upon contact with the ground the nose wheel sank and the aircraft flipped over. according to the technical examination of the engine the connecting rod screws of cylinder #2 had failed due to overload following seizure of the big end bearing due to lack of lubrication. on inspection of the oil pump it was found that the sintered steel drive pinion had lost two teeth located side by side. the reason for this failure could not be determined.
51353,"During a long day of waiting for the weather to improve, the pilot had consumed a certain amount of alcoholic beverages. He finally took off with his passenger in marginal VFR conditions. About 15 minutes after takeoff, the plane struck the side of a mountain at an altitude of 1,200 feet. According to witnesses, the weather conditions in the area were below VFR minimums."
51351,a 30 minute local flight the pilot returned to the lake and attempted to land on a body of shimmering water. as he tried to estimate his height the nose of the aircraft lowered the floats sank into the water and the aircraft capsized.
51350,nose gear leg did not descend when selected in the down position. application of the emergency procedure gave no result. the flight engineer then perforated the bulkhead to try to open the nose wheel doors using a crowbar but this method gave no result. a final unsuccessful attempt was made using compressed air bottles. the captain then carried out a precautionary landing by touching down on the main gear and gently lowering the nose of the aircraft onto the runway. the technical investigation established that the hydraulic systems were operating normally. a laboratory x-ray examination showed that the locking of the strut in the gear-up position was engaged and a test was carried out to verify the correct operation of this mechanism. The shuttle valve has not been checked but given that it controls the three hydraulic circuits it is possible to conclude that its malfunction would have been the cause of the blocking of the front leg.
51346,"cruising at 800 ft/a.g. over a lake the helicopter suddenly lurched 30 to 40 degrees to the left followed by a drop in engine and rotor rpm. the pilot managed to land on a nearby beach after an autorotation at zero speed. after landing and before the pilot reduced the collective pitch the engine restarted at full power because the pilot had not reduced the throttle. under the sudden increase in rotor rpm the collective pitch pitched the aircraft took off while yawing uncontrolled to the left before the pilot could react. the latter to counter the movement chose to cut the throttle and therefore took control of the throttle lever located near the collective pitch control. the helicopter continued its movement the rotor blades struck the ground and the aircraft crashed lying on its right side. a large rock between the skids would have hindered the pilot's maneuver and induced a dynamic tilt. during the investigation it was discovered that the py (pressure detection) line had come loose at the fuel regulator. as soon as the tulip nut was slightly loosened the engine speed decreased. this failure could have been judged as a contributing factor to the accident but it was subsequently discovered that 5 of the 8 fuel filters of the main injectors were largely obstructed by metallic and non-metallic particles which substantially restricted the arrival of fuel. these metallic particles came partly from an initial deterioration of the fuel pump and the non-metallic deposits of the tanks and lines. in addition it was noted that the main filter was not functioning correctly. these defects were apparently the main cause of the engine failure. As for the reason for the sudden increase in engine speed after installation, this could not be determined."
51343,At a height of approximately 300 feet after takeoff the engine stopped. The pilot made an emergency landing and touched down in the last 200 feet of the runway. The aircraft continued to roll for a distance of 425 feet and came to rest between two large piles of wood. No mechanical defects were found and the engine failure is believed to have been caused by an incorrectly positioned fuel selector.
51341,the initial climb the engine failed. the pilot tried to restart it in vain. he made a landing with the gear retracted next to the active runway. a large quantity of water was found in the fuel system.
51337,pilot in cruise flight at an altitude of approximately 500 ft/a.s.l. leaned forward to read the engine instruments. while he was absorbed in his readings the helicopter lost altitude and struck the tops of the trees. on impact the windshield broke off as did the forward portion of the cockpit. at the time of impact the pilot pulled the cyclic back and the aircraft cleared the trees. he was able to return to base at reduced speed and land without incident.
51333,"On takeoff the pilot found that the left main landing gear had broken off and was only holding by the strut. However, he continued his flight to his destination. On landing the aircraft rolled onto its side and the left wing and propeller were damaged. Subsequent inspection found that the left end cap had separated from the oleo cylinder at the braze joint under unidirectional bending overload. It could not be determined whether the failure occurred at loads below the design limits."
51330,engine failed at about 200 feet while the aircraft was climbing after taking off from a body of water. to avoid obstacles the pilot made a tight left turn and decided to land in the direction he was flying downwind. during the turn the aircraft stalled and struck the water almost vertically. the cause of the failure has not been established.
51328,"weather conditions deteriorated the pilot decided to land on the river and wait for improvement. he conducted a reconnaissance to identify possible obstacles and then went on final approach. shortly before impact he saw a power cable crossing the river but was unable to avoid it. the aircraft struck the cable, landed very hard and turned over."
51327,"The student pilot taxied to perform solo training. The atis advised him that the wind was light and variable. However, the forecasts indicated a significant increase in wind over the next hour. During the first landing, the wind strength had reached 15 knots on the left beam (3 knots above the maximum crosswind speed allowed on a cessna 152). Shortly after touchdown, the aircraft drifted to the left of the runway. The student pilot applied power to take off again but was unsuccessful. The aircraft crossed a ditch and struck the bank of earth on the opposite side, damaging the front wheel, the engine mount, the propeller and the leading edge of the left wing."
51318,a strong and gusty wind (not recommended for float flights) the student pilot floated down the river to check the situation for himself rather than accept the advice of a more experienced pilot to wait for the weather to improve. shortly after the pilot left the landing the waves combined with the gusty wind lifted the right wing the left wing hit the water and the airplane flipped over on its back.
51310,During descent shortly after leaving cruising altitude the pilot noticed a gradual drop in power soon followed by engine shutdown and total loss of electrical power. He had to make a forced landing without flaps in a field during which the aircraft capsized as it passed over a mound of earth. The weather conditions at the time of the accident were favorable for carburetor icing.
51303,The pilot made a very low pass over a friend's farm followed by tight turns close to the ground. During a right turn the wing tip hit the ground and the plane crashed.
51298,"during the take-off run on a narrow grass runway, the pilot let the aircraft drift to the left. the left main landing gear then passed into an area of ​​soft ground, increasing the yaw to the left. the pilot then tried to pull his aircraft away but, unable to achieve sufficient lift speed, decided to abort the take-off and cut the engine. however, he was unable to prevent the aircraft from hitting trees at the edge of the runway."
51290,engine failed as the pilot began a left turn after taking off from a lake. he continued his turn in an attempt to land on suitable water. witnesses saw the aircraft plunge into the lake after apparently stalling at 150 feet. examination of the engine revealed that the failure was caused by lack of fuel.
51279,approach the pilot did not initiate his flare in time to avoid landing abruptly. the aircraft landed roughly on the left ski and then bounced. the main rotor cut the tail boom and the helicopter flipped over.
51273,The pilot took off with full flaps and made a 90 degree turn after leaving the ground. Another 90 degree turn was made shortly after. During the flap retraction the aircraft began to plunge into the trees and could not be controlled. The pilot and passenger were slightly injured and the aircraft was almost completely destroyed. After the accident the pilot noticed a layer of frost on the wings which he had not wiped off before takeoff.
51271,that he was attempting to take off on skis in whiteout conditions the pilot realized that he had passed the last markers of the 3000-foot runway built on the ice and that he had not yet reached take-off speed. he aborted the takeoff and during the half-turn he was making to leave in the opposite direction the main landing gear went through the ice. a strong undercurrent was making the ice thinner at this location.
51270,During a series of circuits the student pilot applied the throttle after a landing and began to climb. At about 150 feet above ground level the engine lost power. The instructor took control and pulled the carburetor heat but the engine continued to lose power. While attempting to turn around the aircraft stalled and struck the ground on the nose wheel and then flipped over. On examination of the engine the cause of the loss of power could not be determined (lp 130/81).
51260,The wind on approach was blowing at 25 knots with gusts reaching 45 knots. The student pilot did not compensate sufficiently for the effect of the gusts; his aircraft touched down in the landing zone too short and struck a snow bank located 20 feet from the runway threshold. The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest on its nose 57 feet further down the runway.
50286,the landing run while the speed was decreasing the pilot heard the landing gear warning sound and saw the green light on the nose gear go out. at the same time the aircraft tipped onto its nose. several landing gear tests were carried out without being able to find an explanation for this failure.
50281,cruise the left engine began to give the pilot problems the instruments indicated a drop in fuel pressure and a decrease in the number of revolutions. by starting the electric booster pump and repositioning the fuel selector the pilot was able to keep the engine running for a few minutes then it stopped. the engine was shut down and the pilot diverted to a nearby airport. during the descent the pilot was able to restart the failed engine which operated normally for a few minutes before stopping permanently. on final approach the right engine also stopped and the pilot was forced to make a forced landing 650 ft short of the runway. before departure the copilot and the mechanic had indicated that the tanks contained 800 gallons of fuel more than enough for the flight including the stopover. the flight log however indicates that a total of 4900 pounds or 680 gallons had been put in the tanks. On the first leg (4 hours and 45 minutes) 2750 pounds of fuel were consumed (consumption of 80 gallons/hour). During the second leg after 3 hours and 40 minutes of flight both engines stopped due to fuel starvation.
50280,"pilot landed on the frozen river to deliver six 5-gallon drums of oil to customers. other aircraft had previously landed on the surface, which was reported to have been 14 inches thick. the pilot landed and taxied 500 to 1,000 feet through snow a foot and a half deep, slowing his course to turn and return to the touchdown point where he was to unload the oil and prepare for departure. during the turn the ice gave way and the aircraft sank until the skis touched bottom."
50279,due to weather conditions the pilot made a precautionary landing on a snow covered runway and the landing gear sank into two feet of snow. the pilot had asked about the condition of the runway before landing but was told it must be satisfactory as no information was available. the vfr supplement indicated that limited maintenance was available but the runway had been closed.
50277,"The pilot was taking off from a sloping field and in a crosswind. The helicopter drifted and a skid caught a metal pole, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft."
50273,"The aircraft departed in VFR at night to fly 83 miles to the east. About an hour before the flight, the weather conditions ranged from visual to heavy snow showers and sleet reported at one point on the intended route. The pilot was not instrument rated and had flown mostly in VFR during the day. The aircraft never arrived at its destination and has not yet been found."
50270,"At the direction of his mechanic, the pilot hovered and began a backward translational movement toward another landing area. During the landing, the right skid sank and became entangled in the seaweed. The pilot increased power and applied left cyclic, but the aircraft rolled to the right and the main rotor blades struck the ground."
50264,"as the terrain in the confined area was uneven the pilot kept enough power so that the helicopter did not lean too much on its skis while two passengers disembarked with their luggage. when the pilot opened his door to check that the luggage compartment was closed his logbook fell out. one of the passengers who had already disembarked picked it up and gave it to the pilot. when the pilot raised his collective hand to take his logbook the helicopter rolled over on its right side, seriously injuring one of the passengers. the other passenger and the pilot suffered only minor injuries."
50261,"The pilot was conducting a night flight without the required qualification. He reported over the airport shortly after 0100 hours. Not knowing that the airfield was equipped with the arcal system, he flew several circuits to orient himself and find the longest runway. He finally lined up on what he thought was the runway, although it had gone dark during the final approach. He touched down on the runway, left it and continued for 50 ft in flooded terrain parallel to it. The nose wheel sank into the soft ground, broke off and the aircraft came to rest on its nose."
50260,had been cruising in low cloud for 20 minutes when the engine began to lose power. the pilot applied carburetor heat and immediately opened the throttle but the engine stopped. the float-powered aircraft touched down halfway across the surface of a small lake; the right float was damaged when it struck a stump on the shore. atmospheric conditions were conducive to the formation of carburetor icing.
50257,engine stopped shortly after takeoff. the pilot tried to return to the airport but landed short on the grass surface. the nose gear and the tip of the right wing were damaged. the aircraft had just been refueled but in the right tank only. for takeoff the pilot had activated the left tank unfortunately it was empty.
50246,"Having been cleared for a touch-and-go, the pilot executed the approach and landing at a speed of 70 to 75 knots. Witnesses saw the aircraft land, bounce slightly, and then land again on the nose wheel. This maneuver resulted in a bent nose wheel strut and a twisted propeller."
50241,by a passenger of the presence of submerged stones the pilot inspected the surface of the water before landing but could not discern any. after landing the floats hit a stone and fearing damage to the floats the pilot went around to reach the shore. the aircraft did indeed manage to reach the shore but hit trees and stones before coming to rest on its nose. even though the floats were letting water in the aircraft was not able to slow down as much as the pilot would have hoped.
50238,route de val d'or a montreal the plane gradually suffered a total electrical failure. in the montreal area the only usable part on board was a weak vhf transceiver. the electrical system was completely drained each time the pilot lowered the landing gear. unable to know if his landing gear was properly locked the pilot waited for over an hour requesting assistance and trying to lower his landing gear using emergency procedures. he finally landed despite the landing gear not locked indication the landing gear disappeared on touchdown. the battery electrolyte level was very low. it is believed that this was the result of a regulator failure.
50236,"that he was practicing an autorotation with go-around, the student pilot flared too low and the tail rotor struck the ground. the pilot hovered but, unable to correct the torque following the impact, the helicopter veered to the right. the instructor took over the controls and finally landed heavily after the aircraft had turned 360 degrees."
50233,misjudged his height while trying to hang a banner it wrapped around the main landing gear. nevertheless the pilot climbed to continue his flight. during this time the hook had remained free but subsequently interfered with the operation of the elevators and rudder. the pilot returned to his starting point without being able to eject the hook. having difficulty controlling his aircraft he landed in a soft field at the edge of the runway and the nose gear collapsed.
50224,the engine stopped in cruise flight. during the hard landing in autorotation the landing gear torque tubes and the tail boom were damaged. the fuel shutoff valve was in the closed position. after moving the valve to the open position the engine operated properly.
50221,"approach being crossed by a high voltage line the approach angle had to be greater than normal. the student pilot was unable to land short and the aircraft continued to glide close to the runway while drifting to the left. the left wing began to lower putting the power back on to come back up but the left wing hit a runway marker. the aircraft went off the runway, jumped a ditch and crashed on its nose in a nearby field."
50211,"Having flown over the lake at low altitude and low speed for landing, the aircraft stalled in the final turn, hit a tree with its right wing and finally crashed into the side of a hill."
50206,"engine stopped about a mile from mont-joli airport due to fuel exhaustion. pilot attempted to make a forced landing with a tailwind on a soft, undulating surface. aircraft came to rest inverted."
50204,During a night VFR flight at 3000 ft both engines stopped. Unable to restart them the pilot made a forced landing in a field near farm buildings. The aircraft was damaged when a wing struck a pole support cable and the landing gear collapsed on contact with the rough ground. Subsequent examination revealed no technical fault with the aircraft. The engine failure was attributed to poor fuel management by the pilot. There were approximately 30 gallons remaining in the tanks.
50202,"The pilot had taxied to one end of the small lake to make a 180 degree turn and commence take-off. After lift-off, the aircraft gained altitude only slowly and the pilot was in danger of colliding with the terrain at low speed. He commenced a steep right turn but when he realised he was about to hit the trees, he levelled the wings and pitched the aircraft up in an attempt to break his fall. Unfortunately, the aircraft entered an unstable left spin and crashed into a swamp."
50201,On his approach the pilot used the lake shore to gauge the distance to the shimmering water. Just before the floats hit the water a dust cloud from a truck driving on the dirt road that runs alongside the lake obscured the shore. The pilot then turned on the throttle but the floats hit the water hard. The pilot cut the throttle and landed his aircraft straight ahead.
50200,landing the aircraft bounced three times and then overturned. the private runway was only 1200 ft long and was too short to be used safely. landing roll length tables for this type of aircraft indicate that a distance of 1400 ft is required for landing.
50196,the last spraying pass along the edge of the field the right wing tip was torn off after hitting a guy wire for a power line pole. the aircraft went into an inverted flight after swerving to the right towards two cars and a group of spectators. the propeller went through one of the cars killing two spectators and injuring two others. the aircraft came to rest inverted the pilot was only slightly injured. the very experienced pilot and the farmer had checked the layout of the field the previous day at dusk. the farmer had not given the pilot the sketch showing the obstacles and the pilot had obviously not recorded them all from memory. at the time of the accident the pilot's attention was drawn to a power line 1000 ft ahead at the other end of the field. The spreading was done at very low altitude (less than 2 ft) and required great concentration because a crosswind had to be corrected when carrying out the spreading circuit.
50195,"pilot used to help his friend who owned the aircraft to maintain the aircraft. he had never been given permission to fly the aircraft even though he held a commercial pilot's license. on the night of the accident he was scheduled to meet the owner at the airport to do some maintenance work. because the owner was running late he did a pre-flight check and apparently decided to fly the aircraft without telling the owner or asking permission. because he did not have the ignition key he shorted the starter wires to start the engine. shortly after takeoff at about 200 feet above the ground the aircraft was seen to enter a steep left turn climbing. it then went into a spin. it is believed that the engine was operating at high rpm until the time of impact. the landing gear could not be retracted and the aircraft was always flying with the gear down and locked. this factor in itself was not sufficient to cause the accident. however, it had the effect of increasing the stall speed and drag."
50184,"During a landing approach at Chibougamau, the pilot was unable to extend the right main landing gear. After several attempts to extend it using emergency methods, he decided to return to Saint-Hubert to perform a belly landing. The landing went well, but the aircraft suffered significant damage. The investigation revealed that the forward hinge of the inner door of the right landing gear had broken, preventing the landing gear from extending. Laboratory examination revealed that the failure of the hinge had been accelerated by the development of a fatigue crack caused by the rough grinding of the pushrod weld. This crack reduced the strength of the part until it broke under normal load given its reduced surface area. (LP 154/80)"
50183,"The pilot had requested permission from the Quebec City Tower to land with a receiver only. The Quebec City Tower refused permission and advised him to land at St-Jean Chrysostome. The pilot therefore headed for St-Jean Chrysostome and landed. The runway was so soft that the aircraft capsized. The pilot had not inquired about the condition of the runway from St-Jean Chrysostome. The VFR supplement states under the St-Jean Chrysostome heading: \Runway condition information available from the Quebec City Tower\"". There was no windsock at the airport and the runway was not marked out of service."
50174,"pilot attempted to land on a narrow runway with a left crosswind of 50 to 90 degrees gusting to 30 mph. the pilot stated that after touchdown a strong gust caused the aircraft to turn to the right. the right wheel rolled onto the soft, wet shoulder from the spring thaw and the aircraft flipped over. the pilot had not checked the runway conditions before departure and the crosswind intensity exceeded the aircraft's allowable limits."
50173,"The pilot was making a tight left turn on final approach when he saw himself in front of trees. To avoid a collision, he increased the bank and pulled back on the stick to prevent the aircraft from diving. This caused the aircraft to stall and crash from a height of approximately 20 feet."
50171,while taxiing on the ground the right ski sank into a snow bank and the right landing gear gave way. the landing gear leg support fitting had already been subjected to overload stresses and a small fatigue crack had developed.
50166,"The ""nose wheel up"" selector light remained illuminated after the pilot had indicated ""gear down"". Circling the airfield for an hour, the pilot attempted to obtain assistance from ground technicians and then proceeded to an airport with technical facilities. The landing and subsequent rollout resulted in minimal damage. The aircraft had been flown for 32 hours since leaving the factory. Vibration had caused the nose wheel housing doors to jam inward due to insufficient clearance left when initially installed."
50164,The pilot flew the Fredericton - Quebec route without a flight plan. He did not locate Quebec and after 4 hours of flight he ran out of fuel and the pilot had to make a forced landing in a snowy field. During the approach the plane hit high-voltage lines but landed more or less normally. The tail and nose wheel were seriously damaged in the accident. The pilot was not up to date with his flight training.
50154,on an approach to a power line construction site the pilot hovering at two feet/ground found himself in a whiteout when a six-inch accumulation of fresh snow was kicked up by the rotor wash. as the pilot turned to maintain visual contact with tall trees visible to his right the right skid struck the snow-covered ground and the helicopter rolled onto its side. the pilot's view was limited by frost on the side and lower windows as he had difficulty keeping the windshield defrosted since the defrosting system was not adequate in very cold weather.
50151,After lift-off a loud noise was heard the pilot lost all control of the collective and cyclic pitch controls and the helicopter fell back to the ground. Investigation showed that the main rotor head broke the coupling splines of the mast and the rotor head then began to rotate relative to each other twisting the pitch rods which gave a negative angle of attack to the blades. The breakage was caused by fatigue imposed on the splines. This fatigue was attributed to poor hardening of these parts during manufacture (ref. lp 25/80)
49170,"The pilot had descended to a very low altitude over a farm where he had been employed as a day laborer. While circling above the house to greet its occupants, he rapidly lost altitude. He tried to catch up by applying full throttle and pulling back on the stick, but it was too late because the height available no longer allowed him to escape from this perilous maneuver. The aircraft stalled and descended to the ground in a semi-stall."
49167,landing on the short runway the left wheel struck the ground short of the runway threshold. a loud noise was heard followed by the collapse of the left main landing gear. a broken attachment from the recoil bar was examined and it was concluded that it had broken under the effects of a sudden overload.
49160,lost a wheel while taking off. warned of the situation the pilot returned to land and seriously damaged his aircraft. laboratory report lp 306/79 states in part that the wheel spindle broke because it separated from its fitting. this separation occurred along the fusion weld between the weld and the fitting. the weld had not penetrated sufficiently so that the resistance of the joint was very low.
49152,"slowed by wet, sticky snow, took off from a lake towards higher ground. with a very low indicated airspeed and barely climbing, the aircraft made a left turn and then stalled. a spin began and the aircraft crashed into the water."
49142,"The pilot was attempting to land at dusk with his vision impaired by the chemical spray covering the windshield and side windows. On approach, the left wing struck two apple trees on the edge of the landing strip, causing the aircraft to spin and land next to them. The right tire blew out under the load and the aircraft rolled over."
49134,full flap approach on a short runway the pilot realizing he was too low put the throttle back on but the engine coughed and hesitated too long before restarting. the empennage caught some shrubs the aircraft went down and made a hard landing. the left wing tip and right landing gear were damaged but as the aircraft rolled in a slight left turn the engine restarted and the roll ended some 350 ft further on the nose and right wing.
49130,"landing a wind of about 10 knots was blowing from the left at 70 degrees to the runway centerline. after touchdown the aircraft turned to the left and the pilot applied a go-around but overcorrected so that the aircraft left the runway to the right at an angle of about 60 degrees. the pilot tried to apply a go-around but the aircraft did not accelerate sufficiently because the grass was too long. the aircraft ended up in a ditch seriously damaging the right wing, the propeller and the landing gear."
49127,"During a spraying pass, the aircraft hit a fence post, damaging the right landing gear. The landing gear broke apart on landing and the aircraft did a wood-horse. The pilot had not noticed the post because of a glare of sunlight."
49123,aircraft that were following the same route took off at dawn in fog. the second aircraft took off after the first aircraft entered a climbing right turn. witnesses then saw the second aircraft in a slight climbing left turn. several minutes later it struck the ground at high speed and high engine power. the surviving passenger stated that the pilot lost visual contact with the first aircraft and turned left to provide more separation between the two aircraft. the pilot was not instrument rated.
49122,"The pilot had decided to return the helicopter to his home base because the turbine temperature was constantly approaching the maximum allowable limits. In level flight at 300 ft/a.g., the aircraft suffered a total engine failure. The pilot then executed an autorotation towards a rough and uneven surface and upon landing the helicopter rolled over on its side. A laboratory examination of the defective compressor revealed that the abrasive plastic lining of the counter-case was badly eroded on one side, which disrupted the airflow normally smooth at the axial compressor. This phenomenon would explain the high nozzle temperature that the pilot had noticed. This disrupted flow also caused undesired movements of some of the compressor blades. These vibrations would in turn have caused fatigue cracking and then fracture of a fourth-stage compressor blade and then engine failure. It is not uncommon to find that only one side of the compressor seal is eroded; this erosion is probably due to the stratification of the air passing through the curved inlet chamber during operation in dusty environments. (lp 261/79)"
49118,landing on a lake the pilot noticed smoke coming out of the cowling. he shut down the engine and went to the back of the aircraft to get out his tools. when he returned the fire had engulfed the engine; fearing an explosion the pilot jumped into the water and swam back to shore. as he had not filed a plan or flight notice he was not found until 6 1/2 days later.
49104,The pilot lost control of his aircraft while landing in a crosswind blowing at a speed of 15 to 20 knots. He did a hover and the left landing gear gave way. The fuselage and propeller suffered significant damage.
49100,from a takeoff from a very soft surface the plane began to skid to the left. unable to stop the movement despite full rudder and right brake the pilot decided to abort the takeoff.
49096,"At the time of the go-around after a low approach, the pilot climbed along the runway centerline at the normal climb speed. At a height of about 400 feet, the left wing of the aircraft suddenly dropped and for unknown reasons the pilot lost control. The aircraft lost altitude in a tight left turn until it collided with a barn. The pilot and passenger reported encountering severe turbulence."
49093,"During takeoff, the left float hit a submerged log and the pilot aborted his takeoff. The left float sank into the water, the plane capsized and sank."
49089,"The pilot was carrying out spreading manoeuvres with a load of water. During a pass, the left wheel hit the control truck, damaging the tyre. When landing, the tyre flattened and in order to maintain the direction, the pilot used both brakes, which caused a rollover."
49084,"Landing on a runway covered with a thick layer of snow, the nose gear sank through the crust and broke. The poor condition of the runway was the result of several months of inadequate maintenance."
49082,"the usual landing area was not usable (too sandy) the pilot and his employer took off to look for a usable landing area. the pilot got angry and rushed his maneuvers when his employer asked him to land in an area that seemed too small. he misused the collective pitch controls and went into a pronounced nose-up pitch, after which the aircraft crashed."
49075,pilot was carrying equipment to repair another plane from the same company whose left landing gear had collapsed during a landing on the lake three days earlier. during the landing roll the left ski of the rescue plane hit a large rock and the left landing gear leg collapsed. the pilot had not noticed the rock.
49074,It appears that the pilot was attempting to land on the snowy surface of a snow-covered lake in snowplow conditions. A whiteout eliminated the contrasts on the ground and the pilot did not notice the presence of the 3-foot high snowdrifts. The left ski and landing gear leg broke when the aircraft landed on the uneven surface.
49073,that the aircraft reached a height of 70 feet after a touch and go the engine stopped. the instructor took control and made a forced landing in a small clearing. since the engine and propeller were not damaged a ground check was carried out. the engine started easily and was checked at various power settings. no technical anomalies were detected the reason for the failure has not been determined.
49069,had just taken off and was circling in the wind when it hit some power lines and crashed. The pilot reported that he was aware of the unmarked power lines but had become distracted during takeoff while trying to avoid a snow bank.
49066,was carrying a few empty barrels under a sling. The latter had been poorly secured and shortly after being pulled out came loose. A piece of the securing strap got caught in the tail rotor which was seriously damaged. The pilot tried to autorotate but was unable to maintain directional control and crashed into the trees.
49063,"a climb at 90 mph at 600 ft/gl the pilot felt pedal vibrations for a few seconds. although he applied his left foot to counter the ensuing yaw he was unable to avoid the spin. he then contacted flight dispatch to report a tail rotor failure. en route to the airport the helicopter began to descend in an increasingly tight right turn which prompted the pilot to opt for a landing on a lake. at approximately 300 ft/gl he felt a jerk and the aircraft rapidly descended into a spin. pieces of the tail rotor assembly were found near the helicopter. Laboratory analyses (LP 70/79) determined that the breakage of the swashplate locking nut had caused the loss of use of the rudder pedals and the breakage of the assembly. On 1 December 1978, a Mandatory Service Information Notice (DN-37) specified that this nut had to be tightened. However, this operation was not carried out on this helicopter, which was able to continue flying thanks to the time limit that accompanied the request for intervention. An airworthiness directive to be applied immediately issued on 9 April 1979 required compliance with DN-37."
49059,"The pilot had just landed and was heading toward the parking area when a gust from the left lifted the left wing enough for the right wing and elevator to strike the snow. The damage indicated that the pilot had not applied the opposite aileron into the wind. In addition, the right fuel tank was full while the left tank was only a quarter full."
49052,retracting the landing gear after takeoff the pilot heard a loud noise. having noticed that the nose gear was not completely retracted he performed several landing gear retraction and extension manoeuvres in normal and manual modes without however succeeding in locking the nose gear. the landing gear collapsed during the precautionary landing. the nose gear rear pivot attachment to the airframe broke when the nose wheel jammed against the door hinge fitting due to the partial extension of the front shock absorber during landing gear retraction.
49049,"The pilot was flying low over a river at high speed when he came face to face with a bridge. The aircraft pitched up and banked to the right, narrowly avoiding the upper part of the bridge. This manoeuvre was immediately followed by a steep bank to the left to avoid the church steeple. The aircraft descended and had just returned to the river bed when its skids struck a power line. The aircraft then tipped over, crashed onto its back and slid across the ice to an unfrozen body of water where it sank. All three occupants drowned. This flight was the first in a series to evaluate low-altitude two-way radio communications between various points along the winding, high-banked river and a hydroelectric control centre located upstream. The presence of the unmarked wires at a height of 30 feet across the river had not been brought to the attention of the contractor and consequently of the pilot during the briefing before the mission. Nevertheless, this experienced pilot should have expected this type of obstacle, particularly when flying at low altitude in the vicinity of a hydroelectric installation. At the time of the accident, the sun appeared at 37 degrees above the horizon and at 215 degrees m from the accident site, which is approximately the course the helicopter was following when it struck the electrical wires (LP 29/79 and LP 53/79)."
48059,a normal landing in light wind with full flaps the pilot decided to make two tight turns to reach his camp. the left wing float hit the water and was torn off; and the fuselage was twisted but the pilot was nevertheless able to reach the shore. the pilot had made his turns at too high a speed without compensating with the ailerons.
48057,The pilot shortly after takeoff but before he had reached a safe climbing speed a downdraft slammed the plane into a hill.
48056,takeoff from a narrow field at the end of a technical stop the helicopter in hovering flight raised a lot of dust. the pilot applied throttle to distance himself from it but the engine lost power at about 35 feet altitude. the aircraft touched down hard and the left landing gear collapsed. the turbine had been seriously damaged by overheating during the go-around.
48052,"The pilot stated that the aircraft finally lifted off the snow-covered runway on the third takeoff attempt. He decided to abort the takeoff when he realized that it would be impossible to clear the trees ahead of him. Just before landing, the aircraft flew into a cloud of blowing snow kicked up by a ""ski-dozer"" that was compacting the snow. With no forward visibility, the pilot was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft and the aircraft collided with the ""ski-dozer."""
48049,Pilot lost directional control of his aircraft on landing. The instructor was unable to take back the controls in time to correct the situation. The aircraft left the icy runway and came to a stop in a snow bank.
48047,"The pilot lost directional control of his aircraft while attempting to take off from a narrow, icy runway in moderate crosswinds."
48040,low speed approach on a short runway the pilot started his flare too high. the aircraft then went down and hit the runway hard causing serious damage to the landing gear.
48033,from matagami for forty-five minutes in vfr to eastmain the pilot encountered weather conditions deteriorating to a degree such as had not been predicted. he therefore made an emergency landing on a road. during the landing the aircraft skidded and fell into a 15-foot deep ditch. a layer of wet snow of 3 to 4 inches covered the icy surface of the road.
48028,"As he was trying to take off, the pilot reported that his left float had struck a submerged object, probably a tree trunk. The plane capsized and sank."
48027,The pilot did not think he could stop on the short runway so he decided to go around. After getting airborne again he started a right turn to avoid trees. During the turn the plane stalled and hit a power pole.
48023,"On takeoff from a lake, strong gusty winds caused the pilot to return to his starting point at low speed. The aircraft stalled in a turn and the pilot applied full aileron to straighten the wings. An aileron stall and spin ensued and the aircraft crashed into a swamp."
48021,"having noticed a high cylinder head temperature on the rear engine the pilot landed at mont joli. he called his company's chief pilot; the problem was attributed to a faulty detector. for an unknown reason the pilot decided to take off with only one engine before the rear engine propeller was windmilling. after a long takeoff run the aircraft climbed slowly with the landing gear down and flaps partially extended. at an altitude of approximately 340 feet the pilot announced his intention to return to land. at this point the aircraft entered a tight left turn, stalled and crashed before the pilot could regain control. a thorough laboratory examination of the parts removed from the wreckage indicates that the rear engine mixture control lever was in the choke position; The other parts did not reveal any pre-impact failure (reference LP 238/78, LP 237/78 and LP 278/78)."
48016,"As the seaplane passed over the step, the engine apparently misfired and suffered a partial loss of power. In an attempt to get airborne, the pilot went into emergency mode but only skidded 400 to 500 feet to dry land. The passenger and two witnesses on the ground reported hearing the seaplane misfire and apparently lose power."
48014,reported that the pilot made a low-angle approach over power lines and stopped in a very short distance. on his second flight with passengers this time he followed a similar approach path with flaps at 10 degrees but the elevators caught and tore a cable. the aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude and rolled over. because of the cables in the approach area the runway threshold was shifted and the pilot was warned of this. circumstances required a steeper approach angle and more flaps.
48013,"The pilot made an approach too slow with full flap in a three-quarter left rear wind. On landing the aircraft \""swivelled\"" to the left and despite all the pilot's efforts it left the runway and capsized when the nose wheel sank into the soft sand."
48012,"The pilot had made several stops without refueling. Rather than calculating his fuel consumption, he had relied on his fuel gauges. However, contrary to the gauge's indications, one of the tanks was already empty and the other was clearly very low. The pilot announced his intentions on the radio and set a course for a new airport. The aircraft ran out of fuel on final approach and impacted 700 ft before the runway threshold. The tanks and fuel lines were dry; the flight time was 6:10."
48001,"While climbing after takeoff at about 500 feet the aircraft entered a left spin and crashed into the forest. A fire broke out on impact and the aircraft was completely destroyed. Witnesses near the accident site stated that engine power was reduced at or shortly after the aircraft began to lose altitude and that power was not restored during the descent. A demonstration of the engine revealed no failure or malfunction. The fuel selector had been switched on to \both\"". The autopsy and the pilot's medical records did not reveal any factors likely to cause temporary incapacitation. Since there was no evidence of engine shutdown, airframe or control failure, it was not possible to determine the causes of the throttle reduction or apparent loss of control."
48000,"young pilot who had just passed his private pilot qualification flight five hours earlier called his parents to warn them that he was coming to make a pass over their cottage. on arrival the pilot made two spins followed by a pass at low altitude. during the second pass he presented himself in front of the spectators who were placed on the bank of a small lake surrounded by large trees. the pilot reduced the throttle because a 3/4 tailwind gave him the illusion of high speed. on approaching the lake shore at low altitude tailwind and low speed he applied full throttle and pitched up violently. the plane made a full power dive to the left, stalled and crashed vertically to the ground."
47996,landed long on a wet grass runway and the aircraft overshot the end of the runway. The nose wheel and the right half landing gear struck the rocks and were seriously damaged.
47990,"After performing a low pass over the farm runway, the pilot initiated a left turn. During the turn, he lost control of the aircraft and the aircraft descended rapidly, striking the ground in a steep left-bank attitude. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. The pilot had not flown this type of aircraft for some time. Although his licence had expired, he was persuaded by the owner to make the flight. The aircraft had a valid flight permit, but its airworthiness was in doubt. Several pilots who had tested the aircraft in flight subsequently refused to take the controls again because of its very limited performance."
47985,was carrying four parachutists to the drop zone but about halfway the engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion. The parachutists abandoned the aircraft and the pilot made a forced landing on a road. During the landing roll the pilot applied the brakes and the aircraft flipped over. The brake discs were badly rusted and it appears that the pads seized on the discs when brake pressure was applied.
47979,"The pilot had asked the owner of this amateur-built aircraft to lend it to him so that he could test it in flight. The owner-builder agreed and gave him some recommendations before the flight and pointed out that the controls were very sensitive. The pilot took off in extremely favorable weather conditions, performing two facet rolls followed by two loops. He then disappeared from view of the spectators for a few minutes, who then saw him come back into a 30-degree nose-down attitude at high speed. The pilot performed a sudden tight resource followed by a nose-up exit to level off during which the left wing folded upwards. The aircraft then entered into a roll, losing the left wing, then went into a dead leaf. During the descent, the right wing folded, tearing off part of the fuselage. Laboratory load factor and fatigue tests indicated that a possible weak point existed on the wing attachment rib at the spar attachment; this weakness limited the torsion factors at the spar attachment. In addition, the center spar that had yielded at the wing span was secured by bolts spaced 3.0 inches apart instead of the maximum 1.75 inches as specified on the manufacturer's drawings. (lp 162/78; 163/78; 166/78)"
47975,"the installation of two remanufactured engines several ground tests were carried out and everything appeared ready for a test flight. for this flight the pilot was accompanied by a soul and two passengers. just after takeoff the pilot and the mechanic noticed that the engines were not producing full power although the rpm and manifold pressure were at maximum. they also noticed that the fuel flow was excessively high. the pilot then initiated a wide left turn in order to return to land in the opposite direction on the takeoff runway. the landing gear was down and during the turn the pilot set the flaps to 10 degrees when they were at 25 degrees. the aircraft had reached 200 feet of altitude but gradually lost some during the turn as the pilot tried to maintain a minimum speed of 100 mph. In the vicinity of the runway, the altitude being insufficient to properly manoeuvre, the aircraft overshot the runway centreline and crashed to the left of the runway. This was the first time that the mechanic had installed this type of engine. The aircraft's records indicated that the certificate of airworthiness was no longer valid."
47974,pilot was making a crosswind approach from the right to land on a 6000 foot long runway. on touchdown the aircraft bounced a first time and the pilot added power. the right half landing gear nearly severed during the second touchdown the aircraft bounced again banked on the right wing. the pilot leveled the right wing using the ailerons and overcontrolled on the third touchdown the aircraft went off the left side of the runway and the right half landing gear collapsed.
47972,leveling off at 1000 feet an oil leak occurred on the engine of this homemade aircraft. the pilot began to descend towards a landing zone. the oil then covered the windshield the pilot flared cut the throttle and landed on an abandoned car inflicting significant damage to the aircraft.
47966,at the end of an ifr exercise the student pilot was asked to do a simulated iL approach on one engine to runway 24l at dorval airport. he was also asked to do a go-around with the gear up. the manoeuvre was performed satisfactorily and the pilot returned the aircraft to the left circuit. during the basic stage the instructor gave his student a simulated approach and did the usual pre-landing inspection with the exception of extending the gear to keep the configuration smooth for as long as possible. on final about half a mile from the runway threshold the instructor re-established vfr conditions for his student and forgot to lower the gear. the student therefore had the aircraft with the gear up. according to the instructor the controller did not request the three optional green light signals and the gear warning horn did not sound. The remaining engine had to be kept at high revs which prevented the horn from sounding until the last minute when the throttle was cut for the flare and landing at a time when it was too late to correct.
47964,"It began to drift during the takeoff roll and the pilot pulled back on the stick prematurely. As the drift persisted, the pilot pulled back on the stick again to go over some trees. The plane stalled. It had taken the pilot more than 10 years to accumulate these few hours of flight."
47960,pilot attempted to take off from a wet snow covered runway with a 90 degree crosswind. the aircraft was unable to accelerate to climb speed and struck a tree at the end of the runway.
47955,After take-off the pilot heard a noise and realized that the rear end of one of the skis was pointing forward. On touchdown the aircraft capsized. The registration certificate and the airworthiness certificate were not valid at that date. The installation of the ski had not been approved and the work was unacceptable.
46964,"The pilot had taken off on a local pleasure flight during which he intended to meet a car full of his friends which was heading towards the lake. It was then that he began to execute tight turns above the lake, entering a skidding turn with the obvious intention of impressing his passengers. The aircraft having been banked at 90 degrees, the pilot pulled back on the control column to make a final turn. During this turn the aircraft stalled and struck the surface of the water. The pilot's statements clearly showed that he did not understand the aerodynamic principles of stalling in steep turns."
46957,there were puddles of water the pilot decided to land beyond the first third of the runway. when reaching the end the pilot pitched up too much and the plane stalled and crashed on its back in a plowed field.
46956,took off in gusty winds and began to veer to the left as it was just beginning to take off. The pilot aborted the takeoff but was unable to avoid trees on the shore. The left wing caught branches; the aircraft pivoted and its right wing struck trees. Both wings and the cockpit were damaged.
46952,pilot decided on final approach to disconnect the anti-icing circuit. he inadvertently cut off the fuel supply. if they look similar the corresponding switches are not located next to each other.
46947,"as he was gaining speed to take off from a small lake the pilot realized that he had covered almost all the available distance and that he would not be able to go over the trees on the shore. he aborted his takeoff but continuing on his way the aircraft touched the shore, hit the trees and was considerably damaged."
46946,"pilot took off vertically out of the trees, made a turn and gained speed to enter a normal climb. at about 300 feet from the ground the pilot felt violent vibrations in the tail rotor and lost directional control. he reduced power and landed in the trees. the tail rotor had lost a blade and marks on the hub indicated that it had been struck by an unidentified object. the cargo door was open and it is possible that cargo falling from the open door on takeoff struck the anti-torque rotor (lp 26377 lp 265/77 lp 266/77)."
46945,"As it approached a lake, the plane hit a tree and crashed into the forest."
46943,was flying in increasingly bad weather. During an attempt to turn around he hit the guy wires of a tower and crashed into the trees.
46937,left roberval at 7:30 pm edt to make a vfr flight to rawdon. when the pilot arrived near lac sacacomie it was already dark. he therefore decided to land on the lake. while turning to place himself on final approach left turn while descending the aircraft stalled. the pilot tried to straighten but his low altitude did not allow him to complete his evolution and the aircraft hit the water in a nose-down attitude. the two floats were torn off on impact and the aircraft sank within 15 minutes. the occupants managed to get out and were rescued by a passing boat.
46926,having landed on a river the pilot was steering his aircraft towards the dock when a fuel system failure caused a leak. the gasoline ignited when it came into contact with the exhaust pipe. the persons on board were able to escape unharmed but the aircraft was destroyed by the fire. the investigation revealed a crack in the fuel line where it connects to the booster pump. idling problems had been experienced on several previous flights and the pilot had to leave the pump running continuously to keep the engine running. these problems were not reported to maintenance and no corrective action was taken.
46924,"The pilot had attempted to continue his flight in VFR as the weather conditions continued to deteriorate. When he could no longer maintain visual contact, he landed on the first body of water he saw. Unfortunately, it was a narrow, shallow, winding river strewn with rocks. The aircraft came to rest in the trees 50 feet from the nearest body of water."
46914,"On landing, the plane skidded and bounced before hitting the runway on its nose, thus erasing its front landing gear."
46909,The pilot was taxiing within inches of the ground toward his intended landing point when he noticed that electrical wires were almost touching the tips of the rotor blades. He suddenly applied full left cyclic and the rotor blades struck the water. He had not previously inspected the area to determine what hazards might be present.
46908,The engine failed after a loud noise followed by vibrations. The pilot went into autorotation while heading towards a lake and managed to land on the water after hitting some trees with the rotor. The investigation revealed that it was a ruptured exhaust valve.
46899,"During the climb the propeller broke 9 inches from the tip and due to severe vibration. The subsequent forced landing caused significant damage to the aircraft. Laboratory report 195/77 explains that the blade broke due to fatigue caused by the propagation of a crack from a large, unrepaired notch on the leading edge."
46898,The pilot braked too much during the landing roll and the plane overturned.
46896,The pilot was about to complete his landing when he judged the terrain unsuitable. A skid caught and the aircraft flipped over as he was taking off again.
46893,"gaining altitude to cross a mountain, the aircraft stalled and nose-dived into a spin. The technical investigation confirmed that the engine was running at the time of impact."
46885,"During a landing on shimmering water, the right float sank and the aircraft overturned."
46881,was carrying members of an organization who were making short excursions in the surrounding area. on the first lap after about 15 minutes of flight the pilot came in to land. the speed was higher than normal and he intended to land long. the aircraft drifted to the side of the 30 foot wide runway. with about 600 feet of runway available and the aircraft still in the air the pilot applied full throttle and began to climb. the flaps were partially retracted and as the aircraft lost altitude the pilot attempted to climb at a steeper angle to fly over a power line on his flight path but the aircraft stalled and flipped over upon hitting the ground.
46877,"Due to insufficient compensation for the right crosswind, the aircraft landed on the left side of the runway. It rolled on the soft ground, made a left turn and flipped over."
46875,pilot was making his first water landing of the season. he landed on a river where strong gusts of wind were blowing from the right. the touchdown was normal but once the aircraft slowed the wind lifted the right wing until the left wing struck the water. the aircraft flipped over and came to rest on its back.
46872,"took off from a narrow runway and with a crosswind from the right. the aircraft left the ground at low speed and drifted to the left of the runway. the left ski struck a high snowdrift, causing the aircraft to roll to the left so that the left wingtip struck the snow violently. the wing separated from the fuselage and the aircraft overturned."
46869,"Runway 03 had been closed for the winter due to lack of snow removal. However, cleared areas were visible from the aircraft and the pilot took Runway 03 for Runway 34 (runway in use). While landing, the aircraft hit snowdrifts and overturned."
46865,was moving on the water when the left float began to fill with water. the pilot attempted to take off but was unable to maintain directional control and abandoned the takeoff. shortly thereafter the left float filled with water and the aircraft turned over.
46857,landing in a confined area the tail rotor struck some tree trunks and the pilot lost directional control. the helicopter began to spin and then crashed to the ground and overturned. the landing area was smaller than that prescribed for company operations and had not been properly cleaned and prepared for a helicopter landing. the pilot did not conduct a reconnaissance flight of the area before landing. there was a more suitable area approximately 100 yards away.
46849,drifted to the left during a touch-and-go landing. It hit a snow bank and rolled over.
46846,hit a snow ridge on the runway during the landing roll the aircraft skidded to the left. The pilot first and then the instructor tried in vain to get it back on track.
45866,"During a flight from Fort Chimo to Schefferville, the weather conditions worsened and the pilot decided to return to Fort Chimo. Strong headwinds reduced ground speed considerably. The engine stopped before the aircraft reached Fort Chimo due to fuel exhaustion and the aircraft was damaged following a forced landing."
45862,landing on an icy runway the plane's nose and main landing gear sank. the plane came to rest in four feet of water.
45859,An attempt to take off from a confined space resulted in the main rotor striking a guy wire. The helicopter landed safely.
45852,failed to maintain altitude and struck a tree while attempting to land in a clearing. The temperature and dew point provided conditions conducive to serious carburetor icing.
45851,pilot was attempting a night vfr flight. en route the weather conditions gradually worsened. the pilot lost visual contact and the aircraft crashed into a height.
45840,a low altitude flight the engine lost power. the pilot then turned on the carburetor heat and the engine began to regain power but the plane had already descended too low. the left wing hit a tree and the plane crashed into some bushes.
45839,"After takeoff at about 500 feet the engine lost power. The pilot made a forced landing but the right wing struck a tree causing the aircraft to flip. The conditions were conducive to carburetor icing. See laboratory reports 216/76, 217/76, 218/76 and 220/76."
45838,Shortly after takeoff the pilot experienced aileron trouble. Looking out he noticed that the left wing lower fabric was wrinkled and the left wing forward strut was wobbly. The pilot made a 180 degree turn and increased airspeed. The airplane banked sharply to the right and entered a flat spin and crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Investigation revealed that the left wing forward strut to fuselage attachment pin had not been reinstalled during the maintenance check.
45837,"was on final approach at approximately 50 feet when the ""engine out"" light illuminated. an autorotation attempt failed. the cause of the engine flameouts is unknown (lp 276/76 and lp 266/76); however, the fact that a pushrod and its tube were scored and sticking is probably a factor."
45835,Having started the engine misfired and a fire broke out in the forward compartment under the cabin floor. The pilot tried to extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher but was unsuccessful. He abandoned the aircraft which was consumed in the fire. An over-priming of the engine is believed to have caused the fire.
45832,"During a low-level pass to check the surface of a lake, one end of the wing touched the water. The plane could not be controlled and crashed onto the shore."
45831,"vfr flight the pilot encountered fog and low clouds. the pilot tried to reach his destination by choosing an alternative route but as the weather conditions worsened he decided to land on a nearby lake. the aircraft entered the clouds, stalled and crashed into a nose-down attitude on a wooded slope."
45827,"During a polar bear survey flight, the helicopter landed to allow the biologist to follow on foot what appeared to be a bear that had stopped. The pilot took a weapon and accompanied the biologist. As a safety precaution, the helicopter was left unattended, idling to facilitate a quick takeoff if necessary. After the pilot had moved about 100 feet away, the helicopter rolled onto its right side and was blown to pieces."
45826,"The pilot made a precautionary landing on a field due to irregular engine operation. After touchdown, the plane plunged into a ditch."
45823,returning to base after a one and a half hour flight in the area the weather conditions worsened. seven miles from the airport and due to the imminent loss of visual contact the pilot elected to make a cautionary landing on a road. on touchdown the aircraft left the road and dove into a ditch.
45821,was in translation to the rear and to the left and struck another parked helicopter. The helicopter had been parked there without the pilot's knowledge. The mechanics had not provided ground guidance for the pilot and the helicopter platform did not meet dimensional standards.
45816,"a series of take-offs the aircraft bounced on landing and began to ""roll"". the pilot lost control and the aircraft left the runway."
45805,From 9500 feet the pilot made a long descent with the engine idling. On final approach when the engine was about to go full throttle the engine failed. The aircraft landed in a marsh and overturned a quarter mile from the runway threshold. Carburetor icing was probably the cause of the failure.
45798,having started the pilot left the engine running and went down to check something. the passenger also went down and went under the mast and hit the propeller.
45787,"On takeoff, the aircraft began a left turn despite the pilot's corrective action. The pilot decided to make a 180 degree turn at a height of approximately 20 feet. However, while turning, the aircraft stalled and crashed. The controls were in good condition, but it is possible that the passenger unintentionally blocked the rudder control."
45777,"was heading to the Matagami heliport when the engine stopped due to fuel starvation 2 1/2 miles before the destination. Landing in autorotation, the aircraft landed hard and suffered significant damage."
45775,"An inexperienced pilot was flying over the house of one of his friends. At about 1000 feet/ground he had deliberately pitched his plane up very sharply until it stalled, perhaps even putting it into a turn. Tilting almost vertically, the plane entered a right spin that the pilot was unable to stop. The plane crashed into a street and was destroyed by fire."
45774,"The pilot let his aircraft lose altitude while turning. When the tail rotor touched the trees, the pilot pulled back on the cyclic to climb but without increasing the collective. The helicopter then sank due to lack of collective pitch."
45773,"During an autorotation exercise, the student let the rotor speed drop. The instructor did not take over the controls in time and the helicopter landed hard."
45772,running out of fuel that during a trip the pilot made a forced landing which turned into an accident. the tank had not been refueled before takeoff. the quantity of fuel necessary for the flight had been miscalculated.
45768,was hovering above a boat in a river when it tilted due to a strong gust of wind. The rotor struck the water surface and the helicopter flipped over.
45755,"had taken off, had made two laps of the runway and on the third the engine stopped due to running out of fuel in the downwind leg. The pilot was unable to reach the aerodrome and landed 500 feet short of the runway."
45754,"Having taken off from a frozen lake with a smooth surface, the pilot noticed that the left ski was pointing upwards. During the subsequent landing, the leg and ski separated from the fuselage. It is likely that the left leg was already cracked before the flight."
45750,"After taking off from a lake, the pilot began a turn. The aircraft stalled and fell back onto the surface of the lake."
45747,"The pilot was practicing laps to obtain his night rating. When he reduced power on final approach, the aircraft sank and hit a snow bank at the end of the runway."
45742,"minutes after departure the weather deteriorated rapidly. the pilot did not turn back in the hope of encountering better weather further on. for several hours he continued his flight at 11,000 feet in the clouds. as nightfall approached the pilot descended until he regained visual contact and then made an approach to a frozen lake. whiteout conditions prevented him from judging his altitude and the aircraft landed hard."
105076,the hughes 369d helicopter registration c-gyty with a pilot and two passengers on board was carrying out a flight to transport mining explorers between several sites. the helicopter was to land on a mound that was being used as a depot for mining samples. the aircraft crashed at 1700 edt and then caught fire. it was found lying on its left side at the bottom of the mound. the pilot and the two passengers succumbed to their injuries. the aircraft was destroyed by fire.update: 17/04/02the hughes 369d (500d) c-gyty was being used to transport geological survey personnel and soil samples. the helicopter had picked up two of the survey team and one sample cache and was conducting a circling descent for landing at another cache when the helicopter struck the ground heavily bounced and tumbled. the pilot was fatally injured at impact the passengers survived the impact but later succumbed to their injuries. the helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and the post-impact fire.
104289,"the cessna 172l operated by nadeau air services is performing a training flight north of trois-rivieres under visual flight rules. the instructor, the student pilot and a passenger are on board the aircraft. the weather conditions are suitable for vfr flight. the student pilot is at the controls and occupies the left seat. at around 8 p.m. the aircraft flies north over the saint-maurice river which is enclosed in a valley. a few moments before the accident just before reaching grandes-piles the pilot executes a left turn on a west-northwest heading in order to follow the river; the aircraft then flies facing the sun which is on an azimuth of 298 degrees and at 5 degrees elevation. the aircraft collides with the power lines crossing the saint-maurice.

66720,engine misfired on climb after touch-and-go. engine stopped. pilot landed in a field and plane flipped over. engine failure was caused by electric fuel pump failure.
66630,takeoff the aircraft clipped the treetops and crashed. the pilot stated that when he crossed the power lines the aircraft speed was down to 43 mph. and that he was downwind. the pilot also mentioned that he delayed raising the flaps which delayed acceleration.
66625,"Shortly after takeoff the float-equipped aircraft suffered an engine failure at an altitude of 100 ft agl. The aircraft struck trees and landed on its floats in a pool of water. The pilot reported that he took off using the left tank, which was empty; the right tank was full."
66479,The pilot lost control of the ultralight trike when he attempted to perform a stall maneuver. The aircraft rolled twice and entered a flat spin. The pilot managed to deploy the aircraft's parachute.
66460,The aircraft suffered a loss of control on takeoff and the pilot made an emergency landing in a vacant lot one mile north of the airport. The aircraft was being ferried from Malta to New Jersey. Both occupants suffered facial injuries.
66375,"During the takeoff roll, the pilot observed that his speed was no longer increasing while he was at 80 mph at 3/4 of the runway. He aborted the takeoff, shutting down the engines and applying the brakes. The left landing gear broke aft and the aircraft came to a stop on the runway."
66367,"final the gear lights did not illuminate after the gear down selection. a flyby of the tower confirmed that the main gear had not deployed. the nose wheel was down and the main gear doors were open. the pilot kept the airplane in the air for three hours trying every possible method to lower the gear and burning fuel. on landing the airplane slid onto the aft fuselage and both tail booms. the rear propeller was also bent. an initial check revealed that the hydraulic actuator rod actuating the right main gear door had separated from the actuator cylinder. laboratory examination of the cylinder (cessna part number 1580017-1) revealed that the spring ring (part number ms16625-1068) holding the rod end cap had slipped out of its groove. no breakage was noted on these parts. the free diameter of the ring measured .743 inches while the standard is .763 inches. the material used corresponded to the standard and the diameter found to be less than the standard may have been caused by excessive compression of the ring during installation. the edge of one of the faces of the ring was found to be rounded while the other edge was sharp and almost cutting. these characteristics are the product of the economical manufacturing method made by die-forging and are not included in the standards applying to this ring. the manufacturer indicated that the rounded face should be installed on the piston side which allows for better anchoring in the groove of the face with the sharp edge. However, the maintenance manual does not mention this. The results of the study by the Transport Safety Office laboratory were recorded in the report entitled ""Breakage of a landing gear door hydraulic cylinder"" and bear the number LP 136/91. The anomalies observed gave rise to a safety deficiency report issued by the laboratory on 28 August 1992."""
66246,began to vibrate when the tail wheel touched the ground. the pilot applied elevator to relieve the weight on the tail wheel. the vibrations then diminished but reappeared as the aircraft's speed decreased. the vibrations intensified to the point where the right wheel of the main landing gear broke. the tip of the right wing also touched the ground. the pilot stated that the spring on the right side of the tail wheel was broken and that for this reason the tail wheel continued to rotate from left to right and create vibrations.
66236,After taking off from a short lake the pilot initiated a right turn into an easterly facing valley. The aircraft was in an initial climb with two flaps at an altitude of approximately 40 feet above the trees. The aircraft was hit by a downwind and crashed.

62654,"During a short charter flight, the plane stalled on its left wing and crashed into the side of a hill."
62650,was found in a forest on the intended flight route. The search continues for the missing pieces of the anti-torque rotor.
60665,"After takeoff, the pilot quickly realized that he had difficulty controlling his helicopter."
55046,"en route from the offshore oil rig sedco 709 to halifax airpo crew of the s61 helicopter noted that the main transmission oil pre decreasing and that the torque indication had dropped to zero. as t pressure continued to decrease the pilot decided to carry out a co ditching in the atlantic ocean about six miles from land. after the helicopter was ditched all 17 occupants boarded two life-rafts and rescued by Canadian forces helicopters about one hour later. some o passengers suffered from exposure. the canadian aviation safety board (casb) determined that a tee fit emergency lubrication system failed thus allowing all the main tra gearbox oil to be pumped overboard. the exposure suffered by some o occupants was due to deficiencies in the immersion suits and the in thermal protection of their undergarments. 3.1 cause-related findings 1. the tee fitting in the emergency lubrication system failed as a result of high-cycle fatigue and resulted in the loss of the main gearbox lubrication. 2. the lubrication system design joined the emergency and normal systems at a common tee fitting thus allowing the oil supply to flow overboard once the tee fitting failed. 3. the high-cycle fatigue was caused by a resonant vibration in the aircraft; the cause of the vibration was not determined. 4. the aircraft was returned to service with a substitute fitting although the cause of the two previous failures had not been determined. 5. the procedure used for boarding the life-rafts was not in accordance with the procedure taught in survival training. as a consequence the number 1 life-raft was damaged. 6. some of the immersion suits worn by the occupants leaked water and as a result several occupants suffered from exposure. 7. the undergarments worn by most of the occupants did not provide adequate thermal protection. 3.2 other findings 1. the tee fitting installed in the emergency lubrication system was an aluminum fitting that did not meet the manufacturer's specifications. 2. regulations do not require elts to be included as part of the life-raft equipment. 3. both elts were placed in one life-raft when the helicopter was abandoned. 4. the requirements as stated in the company's operating certificate for the carrying and wearing of immersion suits are inadequate. 5. performance standards for immersion suits worn by crew and passengers for offshore operations were not in place at the time of the occurrence. 6. the life-rafts carried aboard the helicopter had been maintained to an inadequate regulatory standard and were ill-equipped for a long-term survival situation. 7. the flight crew was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. 8. the weight and center of gravity were within the prescribed limits. the s-61 helicopter was in flight after leaving the sedco 709 offshore drilling platform en route to halifax airport when the crew noticed that the main transmission oil pressure was decreasing and that the couple had fallen to zero. As the pressure continued to decrease, the pilot decided to land in the Atlantic Ocean about six miles from land. After the forced landing, all 17 occupants boarded two life rafts. They were rescued by Canadian Forces helicopters about an hour later. Some of the passengers suffered from cold. The Canadian Aviation Safety Board determined that a T-fitting in the emergency lubrication system had ruptured and that any The oil in the main gearbox had been pumped out. Some of the survivors suffered from the cold because their immersion suits were faulty and their undergarments did not provide sufficient thermal protection. 3.1 Established facts relating to causes 1. The emergency lubrication circuit tee failed due to high frequency fatigue. for this reason the lubrication of the main transmission box has not been ensured. 2. the normal and emergency lubrication circuits are connected by a common T-fitting which allows the oil to be discharged to the exterior in the event of a connection failure. 3. the high frequency fatigue was caused by a resonant vibration of the aircraft, the cause of which was not determined. 4. the helicopter was returned to service equipped with a replacement fitting although the reason for the two previous failures was not determined. 5. the procedure used to board the life rafts was not in accordance with the procedure taught during survival training . for this reason raft no. 1 was damaged. 6. some of the"
54299,"Four aircraft took off from Mascouche, Quebec, for a visual flight rules (VFR) pleasure flight to Roberval, Quebec. There were three Cessna 172s and one Piper PA-28. The pilots had decided to fly in formation. En route, the Cessna 172, registration C-FSSI, was flying some distance to the right of the formation leader, while the Piper PA-28, registration C-FGCS, was on the far right of the formation. While cruising at 5,000 feet above sea level (ASL), the Piper was observed to be closing in on the Cessna. The Piper's captain was heard to comment, ""You're too close."" The Piper then nosedived and descended while closing in on the Cessna. The Cessna pilot lost sight of the Piper and began a slight climb. Shortly thereafter, the two aircraft collided. After the impact, the two aircraft remained momentarily entangled until the Cessna pilot managed to free his aircraft by abruptly manipulating the flight controls. The Cessna's engine suffered a complete loss of power, but the pilot was able to restart it and was able to fly to his destination. The Piper was observed spinning and uncontrollable and crashed to the ground. The impact killed both occupants and the aircraft was completely destroyed. Neither pilot had received formal training in formation flying. Furthermore, the pilots had not received a detailed briefing before the flight. the pilots were all on the same radio frequency. there was no indication of any anomaly or technical malfunction prior to the collision. weather conditions played no role in this accident. formation flying is a demanding discipline. extensive training is necessary to learn how to control engine power, maintain position, and maneuver in relation to other aircraft. none of the pilots had received such training. it is likely that the pilot of the piper lost visual contact with the cessna while attempting to control its lateral separation and did not perform a defined maneuver to avoid collision. the damage sustained by the piper at the time of the collision rendered the aircraft uncontrollable and therefore a crash inevitable. Findings Established facts relating to the causes: 1. The pilots involved had not received any formal training for formation flight. 2. The Piper PA-28 collided with the Cessna and suffered damage that rendered it uncontrollable. Other established facts: -none- """
54298,while taxiing to the runway the pilot noticed a cessna 152 making a fixed point at the edge of the apron. he headed towards this aircraft to park next to it. the propeller of his aircraft hit the tip of the cessna's left wing. on this aircraft with conventional landing gear the length of the engine cowling hindered visibility. however the pilot was aware of the cessna's position but he miscalculated his turning radius. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the length of the aircraft's nose hindered the pilot's visibility. 2. the pilot miscalculated his turning radius and the propeller of his aircraft hit the tip of the cessna's left wing. other established facts: -none-
54286,The pilot was flying over hills and encountered fog banks. He continued his flight but the fog thickened and he was unable to turn around without losing sight of the ground. He then decided to make a precautionary landing on a gravel road. After touching down he was forced to rev the engine to pass under a signpost at the side of the road. The aircraft touched down again at the bottom of a slope but on reaching the top the pilot discovered that the road ended in a hedge of trees. He applied the power but overshot the end of the road and struck the trees. The pilot was caught in the fog which closed in on him and was forced to make a precautionary landing. The gravel road would have been suitable for landing if he had not been forced to apply the power to avoid the signpost. as a result the pilot did not have enough space to stop the aircraft or to do a go-around. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot continued his flight despite the thickening fog. 2. a traffic sign placed on the side of the road forced the pilot to go around during his precautionary landing. 3. on the second landing the pilot no longer had enough distance to stop the aircraft or to do a go-around and the aircraft hit the trees. other established facts: -none-
54254,"pilot and three passengers were preparing to take off to return to st-michel des saints (quebec). conditions were suitable for visual flight rules (vfr) flight and the wind was blowing from the south at 10 knots. the pilot aborted his first takeoff because he had difficulty getting airborne. the aircraft was therefore floated towards the northernmost part of the lake; the second takeoff was successful. shortly after liftoff the pilot decided to land on water and made a left turn to land downwind. during the turn the aircraft stalled and made hard contact with the right float; the impact triggered the emergency locator transmitter. the float mast broke but although the aircraft was afloat the cabin was partially submerged. The damage to the aircraft was consistent with a high vertical velocity impact. The aircraft was 100 pounds over the maximum allowable takeoff weight and the center of gravity was 3 inches outside the aft limits. Most of the evidence from the accident could not be examined because the pilot/owner of the aircraft removed it from the accident scene and dismantled it without the investigators' permission. The pilot and passengers were not injured. However, the pilot had warned them not to wear their seat belts because he believed they could interfere with their egress from the aircraft in the event of a water landing or takeoff rollover. All evidence suggests that the aircraft stalled following a turn into a tailwind at low speed because it was overloaded and its centre of gravity was beyond the aft limits. Findings Facts Relating to Cause: 1. The aircraft was 100 pounds over the maximum allowable take-off weight. 2. The centre of gravity was 3 inches aft of the prescribed limits. 3. The aircraft stalled during a low-altitude turn at low speed and into a tailwind. Other Findings: 1. The seat belts were not worn at the pilot's specific request. 2. The pilot/owner removed and dismantled the aircraft without authorization from the responsible authorities."
54243,having taken off from a private runway the aircraft was flying at only a low indicated airspeed. the inexperienced pilot decided to land straight ahead because he was concerned that his aircraft would not continue to fly at a speed below 60 mph. he partially reduced the throttle and the aircraft touched down 400 feet from the end of the runway. seeing that he did not have enough runway length to land successfully he partially applied the throttle to take off again. once again the aircraft was flying at a low indicated airspeed. fearing a catastrophic stall the pilot stalled the aircraft 500 feet beyond the end of the runway. the pilot did not reduce the power enough to land on the runway itself. during initial climb he did not apply full throttle which resulted in a low indicated airspeed. the pilot believed that a stall was imminent at such a speed. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot was inexperienced. 2. on landing the runway length was insufficient. 3. the pilot did not apply full throttle on the second take-off. 4. the pilot knowingly caused the aircraft to stall in the trees. other established facts: none.
54216,"had just completed a solo cross-country flight and was returning to his base on an approach to the departure aerodrome with a wind of 15 to 20 knots blowing from 40 degrees to the left. on touchdown the aircraft bounced, drifted to the right and touched down next to the runway. it then rolled parallel to the runway, struck a marker and continued its course to the end of the runway where the nose wheel passed into a depression in the terrain. the aircraft nose-dived. the aircraft bounced on landing because the rate of descent created by the student pilot or by the variation in wind intensity was too strong. the student pilot lost control of his aircraft on landing and took no corrective action. after the three-hour flight the pilot was experiencing fatigue which impaired his reflexes at the time of landing. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the high rate of descent at the time of touchdown caused the aircraft to bounce. 2. the crosswind caused the aircraft to drift off the runway. 3. the student pilot lost control of the aircraft on landing and took no corrective action. 4. the pilot's reflexes were impaired by fatigue. other established facts: -none-"
54211,"During the approach to landing the captain's seat was set fully aft. The co-pilot, who was occupying the left seat, was flying the approach to runway 09 with a left crosswind of 15 knots. The aircraft touched down on a bare, dry area but when the tail touched down the aircraft yaw and veered towards the side of the runway that was covered in ice and snow. The pilot applied full throttle to the rudder and brakes but the aircraft continued to veer until the left wing and engine made contact with a snowbank. The aircraft spun and entered the snowbank. This type of aircraft with conventional landing gear has a tendency to pitch up when the tail touches down on landing. This tendency increases in crosswinds. in addition, patches of ice on the runway made braking less effective in maintaining directional control. in these conditions, the control column, rudder pedal and brake correction alone without engine correction on the desired side was insufficient to maintain directional control. the captain was unable to assist the pilot during the landing roll. his seat was adjusted fully aft and he could neither reach nor move the controls. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. directional control was not maintained during the crosswind landing. 2. the captain's seat was adjusted fully aft which prevented him from reaching the controls. he was therefore unable to assist the pilot during the landing. other established facts: -none-"
53453,"After takeoff, the aircraft entered a tight turn to the left of the altitude and then struck trees with its left wing. The pilot had never flown an ultralight aircraft before or received any real training on this type of aircraft. It was not possible to establish why he did not maintain his altitude."
53449,takeoff and at a height of approximately 75 ft the pilot began a right turn. during the turn the right engine stopped and he immediately applied full throttle to the left engine. this action aggravated the situation the pilot lost control of the aircraft which entered a spiral rotating 300 degrees before striking the ground with the right wing. the engine operated normally on the test bench; however it stopped on 2 occasions due to spark plug fouling.
53317,"destination advised the pilot that the first part of the runway was covered in snow. when landing on the part he thought was cleared of snow, the pilot encountered small snow banks and then the left wheel finally got caught in the crusted snow. the aircraft pivoted abruptly to the left and came to a stop in a snow bank at the edge of the runway. it suffered damage to the lower cowling of the engine, the propeller and the right wing."
53289,having hovered the helicopter for takeoff the pilot began to move forward along a slight slope. the terrain was very uneven with tree stumps and roots around the takeoff area. after moving about 5 feet the pilot began to pull collective to take off; the aircraft rolled abruptly to the left coming to rest on its left side after the main rotor and tail rotor broke off. upon examining the scene the inspectors found traces of paint from the left skid on a protruding root. the pilot reported that the helicopter may have drifted to the left just before the accident. the only possible conclusion is that a dynamic rollover occurred when the root blocked lateral movement.
53273,the takeoff roll a strong gust of wind lifted the tail of the aircraft causing it to tip onto its nose. the pilot was trying to take off before a thunderstorm that he knew was approaching. however the strong gusts of wind that usually precede thunderstorm cells hit the aircraft during the takeoff roll.
53270,"performed a presentation turn to land near a dock. on short final at an altitude of approximately 175 feet the aircraft made a steep turn to the left. at the end of the turn the pilot realized he was too close to shore and immediately entered a steep turn to the left to avoid the dock. the left wing tip struck the water and the aircraft flipped over and sank. the floats, wings, propeller and engine were damaged. although the pilot estimated the wind direction to be northeast at a speed of approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour and thought he had flown the approach into the wind, two witnesses on the ground, one of them a commercial pilot, indicated that the aircraft had landed downwind. everything seems to show that the pilot made an error in the direction of the wind and that the tailwind caused the aircraft to drift during the turn and the final approach, pushing it too close to its intended landing zone. the pilot did not calculate a sufficient alignment distance that would have allowed him to land near the quay. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. error in assessing the wind and attempting to land near the quay. 2. the pilot did not calculate a sufficient distance that would have allowed him to line up the aircraft for landing. other established facts: -none-"
53268,having made a short local flight the pilot made a low pass to check the landing area. after landing the right float hit a submerged object and the plane capsized. for several years this river had been used for floating timber. in these conditions logs float between two waters and are difficult to see because of the color of the water. the impact marks on the right float suggest that the plane hit one of these partially submerged logs.
53256,takeoff the engine lost power at 150 ft. the pilot attempted to land on another runway but was unable to complete his turn. the aircraft landed on the ground adjacent to the runways; at the end of the run it overturned on the wet ground. the pilot stated that he was unable to obtain all the power necessary either before or during takeoff. the compression of cylinder #3 was only 50 pounds probable explanation for the too low rpm; it is likely that the loss of power after takeoff was caused by the icing of the carburetor itself due to the humidity of 80%.
53247,takeoff at about 50 ft-a-gl the pilot noticed that the ailerons were blocked. he shut down the engine to land but was unable to prevent the piper from drifting to the left into the trees at the edge of the runway. the inspection following the accident revealed that ice had formed on the wing and was preventing the ailerons from moving. there is no doubt that the pilot forgot to perform the flight control operational checks before takeoff.
52352,the weather conditions were below vfr minima when he arrived in the vicinity of the airport where he was to refuel the pilot decided not to continue and to make a precautionary landing on a gravel road. during the landing roll the right landing gear wheel went into tall grass and the aircraft swung to the right then it continued to roll in the grass and overturned. the engine mount as well as the propeller and tail were damaged.
52341,"After leaving the ground, the pilot noticed that his speed had decreased and that his rpm had dropped to 2000 rpm. Unable to accelerate, he landed straight ahead on the remaining part of the runway. The aircraft overshot the end of the runway and stopped 300 ft further on. It was not possible to determine the cause of the loss of power."
52339,The pilot removed snow from the wings of his aircraft before taking off from a frozen lake to check the weather conditions. It was snowing lightly during takeoff. The takeoff roll was longer than usual and once airborne the aircraft was unable to accelerate or climb above 200 feet. During the turn to land on the lake the aircraft sank rapidly and made a hard landing. The airframe sustained substantial damage and the aircraft subsequently sank. A subsequent inspection was unable to determine the cause of the aircraft's poor performance.
52314,During takeoff the pilot took off prematurely and at an altitude of about 10 feet the speed dropped the aircraft fell back brutally on the tip of the wing and the heel of the left float. On impact the tip of the wing curved upwards 6 inches and the fuselage folded behind the left rear strut.
52313,"was intoxicated when he made a run-up. He said he had been ordered to check one of the cylinders. The man did not have a pilot's license and his experience in this field was practically nil, which did not prevent him from taking the runway and taking off without authorization. The chief instructor of the aeroclub took to the air to intercept him and ordered him to follow him back to the airport. The assistant mechanic came to land several times. The aircraft finally touched the ground and bounced a few times. The pilot's disorderly movements on the controls got the better of the nose wheel, which collapsed; the propeller and wings suffered significant damage when the aircraft came to a stop on the side of the runway."
52312,pilot attempted to land after dark on an unlit strip. during descent he had difficulty seeing the ground and could not see the runway markers. he landed on a grassy area 30 feet to the left of the strip. the aircraft rolled a short distance then struck a ditch and overturned.
52304,During the approach the pilot was unable to lower the landing gear and decided to return to his departure point. After several attempts to lower the landing gear using normal and emergency methods he made a landing with the gear up. The technical investigation revealed that part of the landing gear inner well liner had become detached and lodged between the airframe and the tire preventing the landing gear from lowering; either by normal or emergency procedure. It was further discovered that the landing gear motor release handle was incorrectly adjusted and did not allow the engine to be disengaged.
52299,"During a short landing exercise, the student pilot landed halfway down the runway. The instructor took the controls, applied full throttle and retracted the flaps in preparation for a go-around. He was unable to climb quickly enough to avoid the trees at the end of the runway, so the aircraft struck the tops of two trees, damaging the fuselage and wings. The pilot then landed straight ahead in a field dotted with shrubs. On touchdown, the nose gear sank into the ground and the aircraft overturned."
52298,pilot landed his conventional aircraft in a 20 knot crosswind gusting to 25 knots. the aircraft bounced twice and during the bounces the right landing gear collapsed the right wingtip and propeller were subsequently seriously damaged. the runway centreline at chute-des-passes is not published. the pilot did not determine the wind direction relative to the runway centreline. the wind exceeded the published limits for this type of aircraft. in addition the pilot's limited experience with conventional aircraft reduced his chances of a successful landing in such conditions.
52288,"As the pilot was pointing his aircraft into the wind to take off, the tail ski sank into the ice, pierced the fuselage, causing damage to the airframe and jamming the rudder control."
52282,pilot landed; the snow conditions and tailwind did not please him; he decided to go around. the engine did not restart and the pilot had to complete the landing. to lengthen his run he began a shallow turn to the right during which the left ski broke through the thin layer of ice. the left landing gear broke and the aircraft came to rest sideways on the fuselage and the tip of the left wing. the ice was covered with 10 inches of water and the thin top layer was not strong enough to support the aircraft. it is likely that the too rapid go around prevented the engine from responding immediately.
52270,Landing on a short field with a tailwind of 8 knots the pilot lost directional control of his aircraft. The left wheel entered a thick layer of snow the aircraft pivoted to the left and hit a snow bank. Stopping suddenly the aircraft rolled to the right and the tip of the right wing hit the ground.
52264,that he was returning from a local recreational flight the pilot was informed that the weather conditions at the aerodrome were below the vfr minimums. the pilot requested to switch to special vfr which was granted. three miles from the runway following the ILS to line up the pilot flew through an area of ​​snow showers which significantly reduced visibility. relying on the instruments and the landmarks he could discern the pilot continued his approach when suddenly he felt the aircraft touch down. during the touch down; (about 1 nm before the runway) the nose wheel was cut off and the aircraft was seriously damaged.
51358,the presence of fog banks in the area the pilot took off with 3 passengers bound for another fishing camp located on a lake some 2 miles away. the distance being very short and the presence of fog banks prompted the pilot to remain at a very low altitude. in flight he did not see a large fir tree very slightly to his left. discovering the tree at the last moment he raised the left wing to avoid the collision; on the contrary he lowered the other wing which hit the top of the trees. the plane crashed in a very dense forest.
51349,"Having taken off from the narrowest part of the lake, the pilot at about 20 feet altitude turned sharply left towards the longest part of the lake. The aircraft stalled, falling onto its nose and right wing, which were the first to hit the water."
51348,"The pilot and his friend were on a short VFR reconnaissance flight in preparation for their hunting season. Returning an hour later, they encountered a fog bank and while searching for the landing site, the aircraft struck the upper wires of a high-voltage power line. The pilot lost control of his aircraft, which crashed and overturned."
51338,"While practicing laps at night, the pilot misbehaved on approach and landed short. The nose gear, propeller and engine were damaged."
51335,"during an adac approach on a short gravel runway the aircraft touched down 200 feet after the runway threshold, bounced and touched down again 200 feet further on. the pilot was unable to stop in the last 600 feet despite maximum braking and the use of the propeller pitch reverser; the aircraft came to rest 175 feet after the end of the runway among stones and rocks. the pilot had checked the wind direction based on a flag in the village but the wind on the runway was blowing in the opposite direction and the landing was made downwind. the landing chart for normal category operations indicates that 1650 feet is required for an aircraft weighing 11000 pounds in calm winds. the pilot stated that he had followed normal adac procedures for take-off and landing; These procedures had not been authorized."
51332,having used most of the gravel runway for takeoff the pilot tore his aircraft off at 60 mph. the rate of climb displayed by the pilot did not allow him to clear the 7-foot embankment at the end of the runway. the nose wheel struck the top of the obstacle and the aircraft flipped over. the pilot reported that during takeoff the winds were variable.
51331,"taking off from a gravel runway the engine stopped. the pilot made a forced landing in a nearby field but during the landing roll the aircraft struck a ditch causing significant damage to the left wing, landing gear and propeller. following the accident inspection revealed that the fuel filter was sufficiently clogged to cause engine malfunction."
51326,"The pilot was flying over a road at low altitude and at low speed following a friend's car. He made a 180 degree turn to the left and as he straightened his wings the right wing went down. The aircraft stalled, rapidly lost altitude and crashed in a steep dive."
51324,"The pilot had just begun spraying insecticide on a cornfield when the engine lost power during the first 180 degree turn. The pilot lined up with the field and released the load just before landing. During the landing roll the aircraft went into a ditch and the engine separated from the aircraft, causing a fire. Although the investigation was unable to establish the cause of the loss of power, it is likely that it was due to carburettor icing. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to icing and carburettor heat was not used."
51323,that he was practicing water landings the pilot misjudged his height above the water and flared too high. the plane stalled and the pilot lost control. the left wing and the corresponding float hit the water surface and the plane flipped over.
51316,"was returning to base to check the electrical circuit of the main landing gear. During previous flights, the green light on the main landing gear indicator on the right side had gone out after the landing gear extension maneuver. The pilot had then repeated the operation several times until the indicator light came on. The aircraft landed smoothly. The pilot saw the light go out and instinctively retracted the landing gear. He realized his mistake and applied the throttle again, but it was too late; the landing gear retracted and the aircraft ended up on its belly. The technical investigation discovered that the electrical wire between the landing gear down switch and the corresponding indicator light was cut."
51313,"was only authorized to make a local training flight. after takeoff he went to a private airstrip 60 miles away. he landed and at the end of the runway the aircraft got stuck in soft, wet sand. while pushing the aircraft backwards the elevator trim tab sank into the sand and the push-pull rod broke. (lp 250/81 and 251/81) the pilot made a quick inspection of the damage before taking a passenger on a pleasure flight. after takeoff the pilot felt vibrations in the controls and decided to land immediately. on landing the aircraft bounced twice the nose wheel broke and the aircraft flipped over."
51312,cruising at 1200 ft/a.g. the engine suddenly failed. the pilot was unable to restart the engine and then prepared to crash land in a field. when he realized he did not have enough altitude he landed in trees shortly before the intended field. although the investigation revealed numerous aircraft maintenance anomalies such as an extremely worn throttle linkage the exact cause of the engine failure could not be determined.
51308,"The pilot took off at low altitude and at high speed over the camp followed by a resource to pass over a ridge. According to witnesses, the helicopter turned sharply to the left and disappeared behind the hill; three to five seconds later they heard two loud noises. The appearance on the surface of the water in a small bay of waves and debris indicated that the helicopter had crashed. The engine and fuselage (except for portions of the ""t"" tailplane and tail rotor) were recovered. Preliminary examination at the accident site found that the damage pattern was consistent with a high-speed, nose-up impact. Subsequent examination revealed no pre-impact defects that could have contributed to the accident. Inspection of the tail boom concluded that the ""t"" tailplane had been severed from the tail boom by the main rotor blades, which had also struck the tailplane itself (lp 212/81). The airspeed indicator gear position was consistent with an airspeed of approximately 140 mph at the time of impact (lp 222/81). The filaments of the four ""re-ign"" and ""armed"" system indicator lights were greatly stretched and twisted suggesting that they were incandescent at the time of the accident (lp 235/81). the available evidence supports the theory of a turbine flameout followed by an attempt at relighting by the pilot. probably unable to estimate his height due to the darkness and the shimmering water the pilot did not perform an autorotation."
51306,pilot who was performing aerial spraying struck the upper branches of a tree with his right wing while performing a recovery. the aircraft rolled to the right as the pilot applied full throttle in an apparent attempt to regain control. the out-of-control aircraft continued to roll to the right and crashed inverted in a field. it came to rest approximately 540 feet beyond the initial point of impact with the tree. the pilot was fatally injured.
51304,During a simulated engine failure exercise at 3 feet/ground the pilot pulled on the collective but the helicopter collapsed to the ground. When the pilot released the collective as the main rotor rpm dropped the main rotor struck the tail boom.
51297,took off prematurely in an 80 degree crosswind blowing at 23 mph gusting to 26 mph. the pilot held the aircraft airborne for a short distance before it crashed into soft ground to the left of the runway; the aircraft's course was interrupted by some trees. the pilot had only 1 hour and 30 minutes of total flight time on this type. he had received 20 minutes of dual instruction from an unqualified pilot and had completed 2 parachute drop flights. the crosswind strength on the last flight was beyond the pilot's skill and the restrictions imposed on the aircraft. there was no aircraft flight manual available to the pilot.
51296,after takeoff and at about 600 feet the engine suddenly stopped. unable to return to the river the pilot crash-landed in an open field. upon landing the floats scraped the rough terrain and the aircraft overturned. contaminated fuel was found in the carburetor and this may have been the cause of the engine failure but it was also noted after the accident that the fuel selector was in the \off\ position.
51288,the first 2000 feet of the grass runway the pilot began his takeoff roll on the remaining 800 feet. lifting his plane too early he kept the nose low to allow the speed to increase. the landing gear then hit a section of plowed field at the end of the runway and the plane flipped over.
51285,"During spraying operations on an orchard, the aircraft, which had just passed under hydroelectric cables, hit trees. The pilot lost control and the aircraft crashed to the ground."
51282,that the pilot was cruising to his home airport the engine suffered a partial failure due to carburetor icing. the pilot managed to force land in a field. after a while having resolved his engine problem he tried to take off again. the terrain was very bumpy and the nose gear went into a ditch just before tearing it off. despite his damaged gear the pilot continued the maneuver but shortly after the engine ran out of fuel. the aircraft landed on a nearby highway.
51269,"During the landing roll the left landing gear began to collapse. The pilot applied the throttle, then realizing that he did not have enough runway left, he aborted the takeoff and did a hover to avoid contact with the trees. The main landing gear gave way at the center spar and both left wing spars cracked. The investigation revealed that the main landing gear was largely rusted and that the center spar had been temporarily repaired following the appearance of a crack during flight when the flaps were extended."
51265,cruise the pilot felt severe vibrations followed by loss of tail torque control. he managed to land in autorotation and after landing he noticed that the tail rotor blades had struck the tail boom. according to the technical examination the tail rotor control bracket had failed due to low stress vibration fatigue. the bracket was poorly adjusted on the rotor flange and was subjected to abnormal stresses. the reason for this poor adjustment could not be determined and no significant defects in the material used or in the workmanship were found that were relevant to the failure.
51261,"A student pilot with little experience had been authorized by his flying club to go solo despite a wind that exceeded his capabilities and those of his aircraft. On takeoff, unable to maintain control of his aircraft, he decided to interrupt his flight but he hit a snow bank while trying to stop. The propeller, the front wheel leg and the tip of the right wing suffered significant damage."
51258,After take-off on a local flight the pilot reported a drop from 2300 to 2000 rpm. He then turned on the carburettor heat and closed and opened the fuel cock but to no avail. The engine stopped and the pilot made a forced landing on a frozen river whose rough surface caused the landing gear to collapse. Examination revealed that the fuel tank vent pipe had become clogged with clay which caused the engine to fail. The investigation did not reveal how this material had entered the pipe. (laboratory report lp 78/81)
51257,approach being too high the pilot reduced the throttle and extended the flaps. after descending from 2000 to 1200 feet he applied the throttle again and selected carburetor reheat. at the same time the engine stopped completely. unable to restart the engine the pilot made a forced landing with the gear retracted in a snowy field located about 1/4 mile from the runway threshold. the failure was attributed to excessive engine cooling.
50285,"cf-zil landed on c-gufb and severed the rear fuselage. the two aircraft remained entangled in each other, rolling for a distance of 800 feet before stopping at the edge of the runway. the pilot of c-gufb was performing a series of touch-and-gos with standard left circuits. he reported his position (in french) on the unicom frequency each time he began the final leg. he first saw cf-zil on the clear side of the runway downwind and at a slightly higher altitude. while turning onto the left base leg, the pilot of c-gufb saw the other aircraft continuing downwind. he heard a communication (in english) from that aircraft which he interpreted as meaning that he was being given priority. he then reported on final (in french) for a touch and go. as he was about to turn on final he saw the other aircraft starting to turn. the impact occurred as he was accelerating to take off after completing his touch and go. the pilot of cf-zil saw an aircraft taking off as he was approaching the airport. he thought the other aircraft was leaving the area as he had lost sight of it. he executed a non-standard approach on a right base leg and reported on final (in english). as his aircraft was on high final he applied full flaps. he was unaware of the other aircraft until the moment of impact on the flare. as usual both pilots had reported their positions on the unicom frequency in their own official languages ​​but had not understood each other. their reports did not include the \valleyfield unicom\"" indication."
50284,"was traveling on a narrow, dark, snow-covered road. As it approached a hangar, the tip of the right wing struck one of the struts. An assistant who was walking near the left strut was steering the aircraft. He left his position to see what was happening and as he passed in front of the aircraft he was struck by the propeller. The pilot could not see where he was heading because his windshield was blocked."
50275,the fixed take-off point a strong smell of burning followed by smoke then flames came out between the instrument panel and the windshield. the crew immediately warned the control tower fought the start of the fire with the portable extinguisher and abandoned the aircraft. the fire was extinguished by the fire pumps. the investigation revealed that the fire was caused by a short circuit itself caused by the friction of the control cable for opening the external air intakes poorly fixed against the wiring of the electrical circuit of the park sockets.
50272,a simulated forced approach the engine refused to respond to the go-around. the aircraft landed on a major road and was damaged when a wing struck a light pole. the weather conditions favored significant carburetor icing.
50271,"a normal landing the nose gear collapsed on contact with the runway. the nose gear fork collar had broken at the mounting holes. examination revealed that two cracks, each located above a mounting hole, existed before the assembly failed. the element, which was approximately 5000 hours old, had been installed on the aircraft in July 1974 (lp 337/80)."
50266,"During a familiarization flight on multi-engines, the instructor shut down the left engine and asked the student pilot to feather the propeller. The engine, which had been shut down for a long time in cold weather and at low altitude, could not be restarted. The flaps were inadvertently not retracted and when extending the landing gear to make an emergency landing, the pilot lost control of the aircraft."
50265,"The pilot was coming from Riviere du Loup to go to St-Hubert when he decided to make a refueling stop at Trois-Rivières. Having been unable to obtain fuel, he decided to take off and continue to St-Hubert, hoping that the fuel reserve would be sufficient. He ran out of fuel seven miles from his destination and had to make a forced landing in complete darkness in a small, rough field."
50263,cruise flight the pilot noticed a gradual drop in engine rpm. he made a precautionary landing on a cleared forest road but 100 ft after touchdown while rolling on the soft and uneven ground the aircraft pivoted to the right and the right wing tip caught some shrubs. the propeller the right wing and the right landing gear were damaged. the cause of this loss of power could not be determined.
50256,"During takeoff between small islands in James Bay in a 3 to 4 foot swell the plane hit a wave, bounced and became airborne. Upon touching again a gust of wind made it take off again but the plane stalled and hit the surface in a left banked dive."
50255,having waited over an hour on this lake for the weather to improve the pilot took off. there was snow in the area and the freezing level altitude was reported to vary from the surface to 1000 feet. when the pilot leveled off at 400 feet and set cruise he noticed his airspeed was decreasing. about the same time a snowfall caused visibility to drop to 1/2 mile. to overcome a downdraft the pilot applied full throttle and lowered the flaps to the climb position while maintaining 60 to 65 mph. the aircraft continued to descend and struck the ground at high speed and high power. Although the aircraft was exposed to considerable humidity while on the lake and during the subsequent takeoff the pilot never used the pitot tube heat. It is highly likely that during the climb the trapped moisture in the pitot tube turned to ice causing erroneous airspeed indications.
50254,"The pilot misjudged the length of the field while practicing forced landings. Power lines at one end of the 1,000-foot field and trees at the other reduced the length available for landing. The aircraft landed past the midpoint and struck trees at the far end of the field."
50253,that the pilot was preparing to land on water a wing suddenly lowered; the wind was gusting and the water surface was rough. the pilot made an aileron correction but the float hit the water and the aircraft bounced. trying despite everything to complete his landing the pilot then applied the throttle while continuing to use the ailerons but without using the rudder pedals. the float stuck in the water the aircraft turned over and sank.
50251,"Heavy storms forced the pilot to divert from his route and he decided to land on water while waiting for the bad weather to move. Shortly before touchdown, a gust of wind lifted the plane, which hit the left float hard, the left wing hit the water and the plane flipped over."
50248,The pilot began his takeoff run in a 10 to 15 knot crosswind from the right. At this point in the river he had to make a turn of about 30 degrees to be able to take off. The pilot managed to get the left float up but was unable to maintain this attitude. When the left float fell back into the water the aircraft lurched to that side and struck the trees along the bank.
50247,that the rain arrived earlier than expected the pilot did not check the weather before returning to his base. half an hour after takeoff he realized that his ground speed was slower than estimated. thirty minutes later he began to become increasingly interested in the situation when he encountered rain and decreasing visibility. he requested bearings to his destination airfield which placed him 50 nautical miles from his departure airfield and with 36 miles remaining to go. he then decided to land at the nearest aerodrome despite the runway being only 2500 ft long. he established visual contact with the runway and decided to make a left circuit after the fss informed him that runway 34 was in use. During the presentation moderate to heavy rain showers further reduced visibility. He landed long bounced quite high and found he could not stop the aircraft due to hydroplaning. The aircraft skidded through an area of ​​soft terrain with enough speed to break the nose wheel. The aircraft came to rest on its nose and approximately 75 feet from the end of the runway.
50237,having checked the weather conditions at the destination and found them satisfactory the pilot took off for a sixty mile flight. as he approached his destination fog and light rain forced him to descend to two hundred feet to maintain visual contact with the ground. while manoeuvring for landing he lost sight of the airport due to rain fog and falling darkness. unable to find the runway he landed in a field parallel to the runway five hundred feet to the right and on landing the nose gear collapsed. although he checked the weather at the destination the pilot did not inquire about the conditions prevailing for the remainder of the route.
50234,pilot who had recently received his private pilot's license was making a local flight in the montreal area. he landed in st-jean and was heading towards ste-therese as night fell. en route he got lost and decided to make a precautionary landing while it was still light. he landed in a freshly plowed field and the plane flipped over.
50222,"During takeoff from a glassy surface of water the aircraft lost power at an altitude of approximately 25 feet. The aircraft landed hard, the left wing, fuselage and float struts were damaged. The pilot was able to control the aircraft by applying power. Following the accident, water was found in the filters and in parts of the fuel system. The pilot admitted to refueling his aircraft from a canister without using a proper filter."
50217,"During an aerial photography flight the pilot noticed a 150 rpm drop in engine power and landed in a field to determine the cause. When checked, the engine was operating properly. The pilot attempted to take off again. The field was only 500 feet long and had a 4-foot deep ditch covered with grass 8 inches high. Unable to accelerate sufficiently and with no room to abort the landing, the pilot steered the aircraft toward a mound in an attempt to clear the ditch. The aircraft became airborne but crashed into the ditch, tearing off the landing gear."
50214,On a gentle touchdown the right landing gear folded during the landing roll. A green light continued to indicate that the landing gear was locked even after the aircraft had stopped. A technical inspection had been carried out approximately two hours before the accident. Sand accumulated during subsequent flights and an excess of grease applied during the inspection had prevented the proper operation of the landing gear mechanism.
50186,pilot made a forced landing on a road because his fuel gauges suddenly dropped to zero. during the landing roll the right wing struck a signpost. an (aircraft) mechanic reported that the tanks contained at least 13 (imperial) gallons of gasoline. despite several requests for repairs to the company the fuel gauges had still not been repaired.
50185,The pilot reported that his aircraft bounced after a touchdown and then landed sideways on the runway. The left landing gear was torn off and the left wing and empennage sustained significant damage. A crosswind of 13 knots was blowing at the time.
50181,weather conditions below vfr minima (visibility reduced by light snowfall) the pilot made a vfr approach to a runway of restricted length. immediately after touchdown he used maximum propeller pitch reversal and the snow thrown up completely obscured his forward visibility. the aircraft drifted off the runway and crossed a taxiway and the parking area. the nose gear tore off before the aircraft came to rest against a snow and ice bank.
50178,"was slinging a container full of JP-4s weighing approximately 3,000 pounds. After tensioning the sling, the pilot began to fly when he heard a loud noise, causing the helicopter to skid to the left. The pilot released the load and attempted to land, but one of the skids hit the top of a snow bank and the helicopter crashed on its side. Investigation revealed that the short shaft had broken during takeoff. Previous slings had been well below the maximum allowable takeoff weight and the torque at the time of the accident was 42%, but the shaft failure was a typical accident caused by the shaft becoming misaligned while the helicopter was carrying a heavy sling load. The shaft first broke at the transmission output. The movement of the transmission caused the neck on the engine side to become uncoupled. (LP 132/80)"
50176,a hard landing the aircraft bounced and skidded off the runway where the ground was soft. the aircraft flipped over after hitting a pile of earth near the edge of the runway. the student pilot decided to land on this unapproved runway during the spring thaw while the landing area was unfit for aircraft operations.
50170,"The pilot was following the railway line to intercept runway 13 at Sept-Iles airport, then turned and flew over the runway. When he saw the Tacan facility, he decided to cross the airfield to reach the control tower. He no longer had any visual reference to indicate his height. The right skid struck a snow bank and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot had been cleared to go to the company's landing pad in special VFR. He was trying to maintain 25 ft/a.s.l., but the heavy blowing snow affected his perception."
50162,landing the aircraft skidded at the entrance to the taxiway which was 95% covered with ice. the left wheel got stuck on a dry surface and the left landing gear collapsed. the investigation showed that the landing gear mounting bracket was broken at the shock absorber. this breakage was caused by the start of a crack due to oxidation and fatigue at the boss of the bracket. the fatigue crack was created and spread by the residual tension existing inside the forged part and the oxidation was caused by atmospheric pollutants. (lp 129/80)
50160,"The pilot had planned to land near the shore of the lake to maintain visual references to the ground, but following the client's wishes he tried to land in the middle of the lake. During the landing, the snow swirls raised by the rotor made him lose visual references. He continued his landing and the helicopter hit the ground hard."
49174,"two aircraft an otter and a cessna were on converging tracks to the same seaplane base. the cessna passed the otter on the right and then passed in front to establish a right circuit for landing on the lake. the cessna pilot had transmitted his intention to land which the otter pilot interpreted as meaning the bay in front of the company base. consequently as the cessna disappeared to the left the otter pilot was concentrating on his approach to the lake. however the cessna had turned right and was making an approach to the same location. the aircraft were once again on converging tracks. approximately 4 to 5 seconds after the cessna landed the otter's left float struck the cessna's right wing and cowl. the otter landed approximately 200 ft away. At this point the aircraft capsized due to damage to the left float and mast. Five of the eight occupants of the Otter were killed. One of them was unable to free himself from his seat belt. The right wing and cowl of the Cessna were damaged but the aircraft remained afloat. Neither the pilot nor the passengers on board the Cessna were injured. While on final approach, the Cessna pilot had seen the Otter to his right, higher and slightly behind, and had assumed that it was on a parallel approach to his own. The Otter pilot did not see the Cessna at any time during his approach."
49173,"The pilot, who was moving away from the dock, saw a seaplane taxiing on the step directly towards him. He turned right to avoid it. Unable to go any further to the right because of the rocks, he tried to avoid the collision by turning left, but the aircraft that was landing on water was still heading towards him. The right wing of this seaplane hit the right wing of the second aircraft."
49172,a thirty minute training flight the instructor and his student were returning to the airport when the engine suddenly lost power. using the carburetor heater was unsuccessful. using the priming pump increased the engine speed but not enough to maintain altitude. the pilot decided to attempt a forced landing on a motorway but once on final approach he realized that the traffic was too heavy and was forced to land on a small field parallel to the road. the landing was carried out with flaps retracted because the student had inadvertently turned off the master switch.
49171,an attempt to take off on an icy runway and in a crosswind the aircraft began to skid to the left. despite the pilot's efforts to control the aircraft the left wheel struck a snow bank and then continued its course for approximately 75 feet before coming to a stop.
49163,"Flying low over logs along a river, the plane struck a high-voltage cable. The pilot was able to maintain control of his aircraft and made a forced landing on a narrow beach on the edge of the river."
49156,The aircraft disappeared during a flight between Riviere-du-Loup and Baie-Comeau. The pilot was unable to obtain weather information by telephone because of a strike. He stated that he would attempt to pass but would return within 20 minutes if the weather conditions were unfavourable. An analysis of the weather reports indicated that the conditions in the departure area were indeed VFR but that on the route and at the destination the ceiling and visibility were below VFR minimums. The aircraft was not equipped for instrument flight and the pilot did not have an instrument rating.
49155,"The floatplane took off from Lake Edward in marginal weather conditions. Forty miles south along a railroad track, the aircraft struck trees on the side of a hill and burst into flames on impact. The crash occurred in a very narrow valley that offered little chance of turning back for any aircraft entering at low altitude. Fog banks had forced several other pilots flying in the area to turn back or remain on the ground. The pilot was a stubborn businessman who had a reputation for accepting poor weather conditions as a personal challenge. He relied on his intimate knowledge of the surrounding topography to fly in poor weather conditions."
49149,"Two student pilots decided to practice high and low speed landing runs in their newly acquired aircraft. During one run, the pilot applied 10 degrees of flap and increased his speed to about 85 mph, the aircraft took off. The pilot cut the throttle in order to land, but the aircraft bounced and headed toward the edge of the runway. The pilot then applied the throttle again and flew a full circle. He then flew the approach with full flaps at 70 mph. As the aircraft landed, it bounced again. As the bounces became more pronounced, the pilot applied the throttle again to take off again. At this point, while trying to select the flaps to the climb position, the pilot unintentionally displayed \flaps retracted\"". Once they were retracted, the aircraft crashed into the trees. Neither of these student pilots had flown this type of aircraft. Nor had they received any specific training for this type."
49141,the aircraft was coming out of the mouth of a sheltered bay the pilot applied full throttle to take off eastward across the river. on the open waters of the river the wind had increased from 20 to 25 knots from the nnw and the waves increased from 12 to 15 inches to about 3 ft. after 1000 to 1500 ft of takeoff witnesses saw the aircraft bounce because of the force of the waves and the right wing tilt slightly. after another landing after the third bounce the float and the tip of the right wing sank into the water causing the aircraft to overturn. the passenger occupying the right front seat was the only one able to escape from the aircraft.
49140,pilot was practicing slow flight at circuit altitude. witnesses saw the aircraft enter a flat spin before it struck the ground. this was the seventh short flight of the amateur-built aircraft. the pilot had accumulated 22 hours of flight time in the five years since obtaining his private pilot licence. he did not have the minimum of 100 hours required by the flight permit to put the amateur-built aircraft through its first five hours.
49139,"Having taken off from a runway, the pilot forgot to retract the landing gear. When landing, the plane turned over."
49132,"pilot took three hours to complete a flight that normally lasted 1.2 hours. unable to find his destination he landed on two different lakes to get directions. he took off from the second lake with a light tailwind. on takeoff the pilot found that his aircraft was not performing well but continued his takeoff towards high ground. immediately after tearing off his aircraft he turned left to avoid trees and high ground. during the turn the aircraft stalled, rolling to the right and crashed into the lake with the right wing down. the flaps were left in the retracted position and the carburetor heat was at 3/4."
49129,"The pilot had brought his aircraft back to the home base for the 100-hour check. He had previously been advised by maintenance personnel to park his float-equipped aircraft as close to the hangar as possible. While maneuvering near the building, the pilot was momentarily distracted by several barrels of fuel nearby. The main rotor cut through the wall of the hangar, which was covered with light metal. The pilot immediately applied left cyclic, which caused the blades to rise and then hit a large metal crosspiece, throwing the helicopter into the hangar."
49128,"The pilot landed successfully on a lake despite gusty winds and three-foot waves. He then turned to head for shelter, taking the wave abeam. Before reaching shelter, the right float was in the trough of a wave while the left float passed over a crest. The right wing sank into the water and the aircraft flipped over."
49126,"Due to a language difference and his inexperience in dealing with busy airports, the pilot had communication problems with ATC before landing to disembark passengers. During a 1 hour 45 minute stopover, witnesses saw him consuming several glasses of wine at a flying club bar. The pilot again had difficulty on departure when he requested taxiing instructions and advised the controller that he would be following another aircraft that was taxiing for takeoff. When he reached the runway entrance where several other aircraft were waiting, the pilot turned around and took off on the taxiway; in doing so, he cut off another aircraft and nearly collided with an airport vehicle. About 25 minutes after takeoff, while the pilot was apparently trying to determine his position, the left wing struck a 30-foot-high telephone pole on the main street of a village. The wing was struck two feet from its tip. The pilot flew along the road at low altitude for about two kilometers before striking a television antenna, colliding with electrical wires crossing the road, and crashing into a parking lot where he struck several cars."
49125,"During takeoff from a river, the pilot prematurely pulled back on the controls. The right float entered the wake of a boat and the aircraft bounced several times before rotating to the right. The fuselage and right wing were damaged when the latter dragged in the water."
49124,pilot landed too long on a lake too short. the plane hit the surface abruptly and ended up on the shore.
49119,"The beginner, who was only on his fourth solo flight, was already nervous when he felt dizzy and excited after being ordered to go around due to an in-flight conflict. He then decided to abort his flight, which consisted of a series of touch-and-goes, and requested a complete stop. His dizziness and nervousness appeared during the final approach, which was facing the sun. He badly executed his flare and when he hit the ground, the nose wheel and propeller were damaged. The aircraft swerved on the runway and came to a stop on its nose."
49106,"During an attempt to land in a restricted landing area, the helicopter was caught in a downdraft and the tail rotor struck a tree. The anti-torque control was rendered ineffective and the helicopter began to roll to the right. The pilot reduced collective pitch but the resulting high rate of descent could not be stopped before contact with the ground and the helicopter landed hard."
49105,licensed pilot was undergoing a multi-engine procedures check. after 30 minutes of local flight the aircraft returned to base. during the landing roll the pilot retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps.
49099,left the gouin reservoir to st. marc-sur-richelieu. the small group had spent the weekend fishing in the area. shortly after takeoff the weather began to deteriorate. as the plane and its passengers descended south the ceiling dropped they encountered heavy rain showers and visibility decreased. knowing that he would not be able to reach his destination the pilot began looking for a suitable lake to make a precautionary landing. the passenger on the right was also a pilot. he chose a lake and told the pilot flying to land there. he also manipulated the elevator control to persuade him. the pilot's attention was therefore diverted. he had little time left to study his approach but he decided to land anyway. rushed the approach was also too high and he had to climb back he avoided a steep hill over which the aircraft stalled and crashed. although this passenger was seen touching the controls before landing it is not possible to determine whether he also touched them just before the stall in which case he would have contributed to the loss of control at a critical moment. the investigation concluded that the aircraft was airworthy before the accident and at or near its maximum weight.
49091,"pilot was performing touch-and-go maneuvers along the entire length of the runway. the last approach was too long and he attempted to make a 180 degree turn to land. he made a turn with too great a bank, lost control and landed hard. the pilot lacked dual instruction on this type of aircraft."
49090,Pilot was on a local flight to practice various in-flight maneuvers. When applying power to initiate a go-around during a forced landing practice the engine failed to respond. Carburetor heat was applied without success. During the landing roll following the forced landing the aircraft struck a barn at the far end of the field.
49086,"that the speed was below VMC the instructor \simulated\"" an engine failure during the takeoff roll by cutting the mixture on the right engine. the student pilot tried to continue the takeoff instead of aborting it but the instructor did not take over the controls before the aircraft skidded and left the runway. the aircraft took off momentarily then fell back onto the adjacent field. the nose and right landing gear collapsed. """
49085,"landed long, veered off the narrow runway and capsized when the nose gear collapsed on soft ground. Although other aircraft were using the reciprocal runway due to the sun being low on the horizon the pilot landed without flaps facing the blinding sun."
49083,the beginning of the summer float flights a thorough maintenance was carried out on the aircraft. one of the maintenance items was the adjustment of a control wheel bushing. to carry out this work the aileron control cables and chain had to be dismantled. when reinstalling the chain part of the control cable the half turn between the lower pulley and the upper chain sprocket was forgotten. the aileron movement was then reversed. the mechanic and engineer checked that the controls were functioning correctly. the pilot also stated that he had checked the controls at the time of his pre-flight inspection and found them to be functioning satisfactorily. during the take-off roll the pilot attempted to raise the right wing by turning the half-wheel to the left. the right wing sank further until it struck the water. The plane capsized and ended up on its back.
49078,"The pilot was making a low-speed, low-altitude pass over the runway to check its condition before landing. Having come too close to the trees at the end of the runway, he added power and pulled gently on the controls but was unable to avoid a collision. The aircraft struck the treetops, stalled and crashed into the woods."
49070,pilot landed his aircraft on skis on snowy ground the landing strip on the adjacent river having been advised against because it was too soft. he performed a go-around after landing in order to avoid an imminent collision with a barn. he prematurely tore his aircraft off to avoid a parked aircraft then he had to turn to avoid a hangar and it was at this point that the wing tip struck the ground. the aircraft stalled and struck the river bank.
49068,"pilot took off from montreal for a training flight and after an approach to mirabel noticed a malfunction of the nose gear. he therefore put the go-around back on and contacted the dorval tower. after trying to extend the gear he realized that the main gear was extending but that the nose gear light indicated \gear not locked\"". the pilot then tried to extend the gear using emergency procedures but again without success. after two passes at low altitude he decided to land with the nose gear retracted. extending the nose gear was made impossible by the incorrect installation of a bolt in the gear extension device. """
49061,"The pilot reported being blinded by the setting sun shortly before landing. Dazzled, he lost ground reference and forward vision and then hit a power line before landing straight ahead."
49060,"After takeoff and at approximately 100 feet altitude, both engines experienced a significant loss of power. Unable to maintain airspeed and altitude, the captain flew the aircraft into a small open area near a residential area. Immediately after contact with the ground, the aircraft rolled over. Technical investigation revealed ice in the left inner fuel system filter and in the bowls of both carburetors. The venturi of both carburetors was covered with white crystallized particles; and the filters of both engines were partially covered with a layer of ice. One week before this flight, both engines had failed while taxiing and the aircraft had been returned to the hangar. An inspection had discovered ice 3/8 inch thick in the filter and fuel system of the left engine. After emptying the left internal tank it was refuelled and a run-up was carried out. The fuel drains were checked and no water was observed. The aircraft was then parked outside without any protection from the weather. Just before this flight the ground engineer had warmed up the engines and taken a fuel sample from the drain cocks. He found that the right drain cock was flowing very slowly so he warmed it up a little more. He started the engines, checked temperatures and pressures and then set up the aircraft for flight. The crew reported that everything was normal during the run-up and pre-takeoff checks."
49056,During the final approach the helicopter's engine speed dropped and the pilot had to make a forced landing in the snow before the intended landing area. The investigation revealed that the third stage of the turbine had failed. A service letter had been issued requesting operators not to operate engines of this series in a certain speed range #2. The operator had not followed this recommendation. The turbine failure is similar to other failures that have occurred due to operation in this prohibited speed range.
49055,"crashed off the edge of the runway while the pilot was attempting a soft-field takeoff. the narrow runway had not been plowed for three weeks and was covered in a thick layer of fresh snow. the pilot began a short takeoff with 20 degrees of flap in a 30 to 40 degree wind from the left gusting to 25 knots. the airplane, which was equipped with regular tires and had no nose skis, had difficulty gaining speed. with the control column fully aft, the airplane flared, climbed about 15 feet, drifted to the right, and then stalled. the pilot reduced power moments before the airplane struck the ground to the right of the runway."
49051,The pilot reported that during a short takeoff exercise on a recently cleared field his aircraft swung to the right and came to rest in a snow bank at the edge of the runway. The left wing was damaged as a result of this partial hover.
49048,"Having applied full power during a touch-and-go, the student lost control of his aircraft. The latter left the runway, hit a light and then capsized after hitting a snow bank. The pilot reported that he had applied the throttle more quickly than usual and that he was surprised by the rapid reaction of the aircraft. He therefore overcorrected with the rudder pedals, causing the aircraft to pivot to the left."
48042,"The pilot of the float aircraft stated that he was on final approach at 90 knots with flaps set to 3/4. He intended to land short and perform a touch-and-go. He suddenly saw a flicker of light on the water and realizing that he was too low applied the throttle and pulled back on the controls. The front of the floats hit the water and the aircraft flipped over. The pilot's license required corrective lenses. He stated that he had recently started wearing bifocals and that this was the first time he had worn them in flight. Because of the arrangement of the bifocal lenses, the pilot looked through the lower lenses (which were designed for reading) and thus misjudged his height above the water. It should be noted that at the time of the accident the wind was very light and therefore the possibility of an optical illusion due to the shimmering water cannot be excluded."
48041,"landing the pilot quickly reduced collective pitch to 46% torque to pack the snow. passengers disembarked, took out their gear and stood away from the helicopter. while looking left to make sure no seat belts were hanging out the door the pilot lowered collective and reduced torque. at that point the aircraft rolled onto its right side before the pilot could react."
48037,"attempting for the second time to go to lac de la tortue from st-hubert in vfr conditions the pilot encountered bad weather and had to choose a field to make a precautionary landing. while flying over an open field the aircraft stalled, pitched down and crashed on its nose with its right wing down. the aircraft was a total loss; the three occupants died instantly. the aircraft had been rented by the same pilot for both flights and during the second a friend who was also a pilot seated in the left seat acted as pilot-in-command. both pilots were type-rated but neither of them had an instrument rating. no flight plan was filed and there is no indication that the pilots checked the weather before their departure. The aircraft left St-Hubert at 10:50 and at approximately 11:30, 12 miles from its destination, witnesses saw it fly over a road at an estimated height of 200 to 250 feet. The aircraft then headed east of the road and crashed in a field. Witnesses not far from the accident site reported the presence of low clouds and dense fog at that time. They also noted that the engine appeared to misfire before the crash. The prevailing weather conditions were conducive to carburetor icing. The technical investigation revealed no defects in the engine or any of its components. Consequently, it appears that the loss of control of the aircraft occurred when the pilot attempted to land, either because of bad weather or because the engine misfired."
48035,"The pilot reported that he had 4 hours of autonomy and that after 1 hour 55 minutes of flight he had switched from the left tank to the right tank. The engine stopped shortly after and could not be restarted. Unable to reach an airport, the pilot made a forced landing in a small field in the middle of a residential area. After the accident, investigators found the fuel selector located on the left tank. Disassembly of the engine revealed no cause of failure."
48031,"The aircraft's takeoff weight was approaching the maximum gross weight. During the takeoff roll, the pilot gradually applied the flaps to encourage the aircraft to pass over the step and break away. After takeoff, he attempted a left turn at low speed towards a hill; the aircraft crashed into the trees. The pilot could have continued his roll over the lake to gain speed and altitude before initiating the turn."
48029,"the student with an instructor was practicing night touch-and-gos. on the ninth takeoff the aircraft climbed to about 380 ft. stalled, entered a rapid right descent, striking the ground in a 30 degree nose-down attitude. both occupants were killed and the wreckage destroyed by fire. the student had flown several times during the last 11 hours, having made his first flight at 0800 EST on a cessna 185 floatplane, then in the afternoon before made a type check flight on a cessna 172 floatplane, and at 1800 EST flew the beech 19a aircraft, which he had not flown for five months. this was also his first night flight training session."
48024,having landed his seaplane the pilot reported that a very strong gust had lifted the right wing so much that the left wing plunged into the water. unable to turn his plane and return to camp the pilot decided to take off. during takeoff the floats plunged into the waves and the plane turned over.
48020,"a normal landing run the pilot wanted to compensate for a drift to the right but realized that the rudder pedal was blocked. he then pressed the left brake but the plane swerved, left the runway and the right landing gear hit a counter-lacquer marker. the passenger had put pressure on the pedals while taxiing. nervous in a car, he had the instinctive habit of simulating braking. flying for the first time in a light aircraft, the same reflex came back to him during landing."
48017,"Low ceiling and reduced visibility The pilot inadvertently entered the clouds. Believing his canopy to be fogged up, he leaned over to grab a rag, triggering a steep descent. The helicopter hit the trees, pivoted around its vertical axis and came to a stop in the forest."
48008,"On final approach at 40 ft above the runway the aircraft rolled to the left and then lost control; the left wing and engine struck the ILS slope indicator antenna. The aircraft continued its course and crashed inverted beyond the antenna. The cause of the uncontrolled descent could not be determined. The technical investigation revealed no malfunctions in the various flight control systems including the flap linkage, the propellers, the governors, the \beta\"" backup system and the engines. Although it was not possible to locate a 6-inch segment of one of the flap control rods, other evidence tends to confirm that this rod was intact and the corresponding flap was extended. No evidence of incapacitation was found among the crew. """
47994,During takeoff in a gusty crosswind the right wing struck the water surface and the aircraft collided with trees and rocks on the lake shore. The pilot did not have a float rating.
47992,"having checked the windsock indication and made a precautionary approach to runway 31 the pilot made a normal circuit and landed. after a landing roll of approximately 100 feet the aircraft skidded to the right, left the runway, struck a marker and stopped in a ditch. the pilot had landed with a 3/4 left tailwind."
47987,at 300 feet agl while climbing the engine stopped due to running out of fuel. the pilot selected the front tank which contained 16 gallons of fuel he tried to restart the engine but he had neither the time nor the altitude to perform this maneuver. the plane crashed on the wooded slope of a mountain. the pilot had selected the center tank for takeoff because it contained 8 gallons of fuel according to the gauge when in fact the tank was almost empty.
47981,"During his pre-flight inspection, the pilot visually checked only the contents of the right tank and noted that both fuel gauges indicated three-quarters full. He took off for a flight of approximately 35 minutes using the left tank. During the approach, the pilot cut the altitude hold on the autopilot and set a descent rate of 700 feet per minute using the autopilot trim. At 2,000 feet, the engine stopped due to fuel starvation; the left tank was empty. The pilot changed tanks (right tank) but did not immediately start the fuel pump. When he did, he left it on too long, flooding the engine, which was never able to start. The aircraft was in a rapid descent; the pilot tried to achieve optimum gliding speed; he pulled back on the stick without disconnecting the autopilot. the automatic electric trim tab therefore reacted in the opposite direction and coupled by the clutch to the autopilot cylinder made the controls very hard. the pilot decided to land on runway 28 at cartierville. he lowered the flaps but did not extend the landing gear and the aircraft landed on the runway 1500 feet after the runway threshold. on impact the engine restarted and the aircraft pitched sharply, touched the runway 200 feet further on, bounced, skidded and finally stopped. the safety pin on the autopilot cylinder sheared on the first impact allowing the aircraft to pitch sharply."
47965,a short flight the pilot returned to the airport because the wind speed was increasing as well as the gusts. in crosswind stage a gust made the pilot lose control for a moment and he forgot to lower the landing gear. the aircraft landed with the landing gear retracted.
47963,the aircraft was taking off again after a touch-and-go the instructor cut the throttle to do a forced landing exercise. the student overcorrected and the instructor took back the controls. the student had applied the brakes and when landing the aircraft had flipped over.
47957,that he was on a night vfr flight the pilot encountered adverse weather conditions. as he continued towards his destination ice accumulated on the antennas rendering the navigation radios unusable. the pilot continued flying ten minutes after his estimated time of arrival then turned around and flew the opposite heading until he was out of the clouds. he had been flying for about five hours at the time and his fuel tanks were almost empty. during the precautionary landing the aircraft struck the ice surface of a lake in a nose-down attitude. the pilot had received a weather report and was advised that the weather conditions were expected to deteriorate around his arrival time. he nevertheless decided to depart for business reasons.
47953,the aircraft was banking to the left the pilot tried to get back in the air. the aircraft skidded but the tail wheel hit a snow bank which reduced the speed. the main wheels sank into the deep snow at the side of the runway and the aircraft turned over.
47944,"During a forced landing exercise the pilot did not apply enough power to keep the engine warm. When the engine went around, it lost power and the aircraft hit some electrical wires and had to land in a field."
47943,"On the fourth takeoff attempt, the aircraft took off but appeared to experience a momentary loss of power. However, the pilot continued the takeoff as soon as the power returned. The aircraft managed to skim over the frozen river beyond the end of the runway but immediately sank and crashed into the riverbank."
47933,"was on a vfr flight from waterville n.s. to sherbrooke quebec after a 15 minute stopover in fredricton. about an hour after departing fredricton while cruising at 8000 feet the pilot noticed that his fuel reserve was rapidly decreasing. he notified sherbrooke radio and reported that he was proceeding directly to the airport. shortly thereafter his engine stopped and he notified sherbrooke that he was making an emergency landing. the aircraft landed in a snowy field and the nose gear, propeller and engine cowlings were damaged. the technical investigation showed that the engine failure was caused by a lack of fuel. both tanks, lines and carburetor were completely empty. A complete examination of the aircraft revealed no signs of leakage or venting. Before departure from Waterville, 25.3 gallons of gasoline were added and both the gas station attendant and the pilot checked that the tanks were full. With full tanks, the aircraft can normally fly for six hours with an average fuel consumption of 8 gallons per hour. However, after about two hours and twenty minutes of flight, the engine stopped due to lack of fuel. No explanation could be found for this mysterious disappearance of the fuel."
46955,"During a night VFR navigation flight in limited weather conditions, the aircraft struck high-voltage wires before crashing. The pilot did not have night flight qualifications and no flight plan had been filed. Visibility at the time of the accident could not be determined."
46951,turned left on final approach and touched down short of the runway before overturning.
46949,from the ground run after landing the landing gear was momentarily retracted and collapsed.
46948,"was performing landings with re-takeoffs. After touching down, the student retracted the landing gear instead of raising the flaps, damaging the propeller and the belly of the aircraft."
46939,"The purpose of the flight was to check the pilot's instrument rating. Just before touchdown for a touch-and-go, the pilot noticed that the three green indicators on the landing gear were not illuminated. He then performed a go-around. The navigation and communication radios were not functioning. The ammeters indicated zero load. The pilot did not attempt to retract the gear during the go-around. He decided to land on another runway. He assumed that the landing gear was down and locked because he thought it had made the right sound when the gear was initially extended. In addition, he could see the nose gear extended through the mirror mounted on the left engine. The emergency gear extension was not used. The landing gear collapsed. It was impossible to determine why there was no load."
46935,a long day the pilot was making a straight-in approach for a night landing. he was descending under power with a low vario with no flaps and he had not lowered his landing gear. the initial contact was made about 1000 feet after the runway threshold when both propellers touched down. the aircraft landed with the landing gear up and skidded for a distance of 1000 feet before coming to a stop. the pilot stated that he did not hear the landing gear down warning buzzer.
46925,"Having gone around during the first approach due to obstructing traffic, the student pilot made another circuit in preparation for a landing on runway 34 at Roberval airport. On the downwind leg, he encountered heavy rain showers and minimal visibility. He reduced power, turned left to approach the base course and began a descent. At about 30 feet above the ground, the aircraft struck electrical wires, nosedived and struck the ground. It came to a stop 1,000 feet from the runway threshold."
46921,"had climbed 100 feet after takeoff when its engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion. after landing on what was left of the runway the aircraft bounced a few times, rolled between a fuel pump and a shack and finally came to a stop after the runway extension in a hollow in the rough ground. before the five-minute flight he intended to make the pilot had noticed that both needles on the fuel gauges were pointing to almost zero. however, he estimated, based on previous flight time, that he had 25 minutes of fuel remaining. he had not visually checked his tanks for confirmation. after the accident it was found that the two tanks contained a total of about 1/2 pint of fuel."
46920,nose gear and then the main gear gave way on landing. following a number of hard landings the engine and the landing gear kinematics had suffered stresses and deformations which prevented the drag strut from ensuring satisfactory locking.
46918,bounced on landing and touched the runway in a nose-down attitude.
46917,"As a training flight, the pilot was flying the first night circuits of his career. While on the downwind leg during the third lap, the right wing leading edge skin partially detached. The laminar flow failure resulted in a significant loss of lift and the disabled aircraft spiraled to the ground near the runway. A 5-foot-long section of the right wing leading edge was found one mile from the crash site. A technical examination showed that the wing had failed due to overloading, which could not be determined whether it was external or aerodynamic. There was no other evidence of failure of the engine airframe or its components. the aircraft was equipped only to meet the minimum requirements for night flight within sight of the airfield. (lp 245/77)"
46916,"15 minutes into the flight, the pilot decided to make a precautionary landing in an oat field. The ground, which was partially hidden by the oats, was rough. The plane capsized on landing."
46910,The pilot was attempting to secure the aircraft in strong gusts of wind. He asked the passenger to get down on the float and help him. The propeller severed the passenger's hand as he attempted to pull a rope from the front leg of the float.
46907,"Due to too much play in the lower lock, the nose gear collapsed during the landing run."
46903,engine stopped due to fuel starvation on final approach. pilot had to make a forced landing before reaching the runway. he had allowed the selected tank to empty.
46902,Shortly after takeoff the engine lost power and the pilot was unable to maintain altitude. While attempting to reach a clear field he allowed the speed to decrease and the aircraft stalled in the trees. Conditions were conducive to carburetor icing.
46901,that his aircraft was overloaded for takeoff the pilot decided to drain 10 gallons of fuel. on the second attempt the general pitch was excessive the rudder dropped and the aircraft crashed into the trees. the counterweight had failed and the pilot lost control. the helicopter was still overloaded on the second takeoff. the pilot had few flight hours and was forced to make decisions that were too important given his experience.
46900,that the aircraft was approaching a seaport the pilot spotted another aircraft at the same altitude in the opposite direction. he tried to disengage but during his descending turn he hit the other aircraft with the left wing. both aircraft were able to land safely. they had just entered a full control zone but the pilot in question had not contacted the control unit for clearance.
46895,"The pilot continued his flight despite poor visibility and a low ceiling. When he tried to turn around, the aircraft crashed into a wooded mountainside."
46882,"This was the first flight of the amateur-built aircraft. After takeoff, the pilot stabilized the speed at a constant altitude of about 75 feet. He tried to gain speed by slightly pitching down, but the rate of descent suddenly increased. Believing it was a partial loss of power, the pilot reduced the throttle and landed straight ahead, overshooting the end of the runway. The throttle cable was incorrectly adjusted and was only providing 75% of the engine power."
46878,from a crosswind landing the left landing leg broke. the aircraft turned to the right and capsized.
46874,"and his instructor were practicing forced landings. At about 100 ft agl the student applied the throttle but the engine did not respond. The aircraft touched down, sank into the soft ground and came to a stop within seconds. The propeller and left wing were damaged."
46870,during a takeoff on a snowy and rough surface the screw securing the right landing gear strut to the fuselage broke allowing the landing gear to collapse under the fuselage on landing. instructions in the de havilland technical bulletin recommending a special inspection of this screw were not followed. laboratory report lp 93/77 states that the failure of the screw was attributable to the propagation of a crack originating from the lubrication hole.
46864,touching on a rough hard snow surface the right ski hit a snow ridge and the right landing gear broke.
46862,"was on an authorized solo cross-country flight and had obtained permission from the instructor to extend his flight to a friend's residence. upon arrival he landed the aircraft in a nearby steeply sloping field and the tail rotor struck deep, wet snow without his realizing it. he then took off for another flight with the intention of landing on a nearby road. he hovered while heading toward a level surface of the road. at this point he lost pedal control and the helicopter spun twice and crashed. the failure was apparently attributable to the tail rotor striking the snow during the first landing. the student pilot did not have a student pilot licence or an aircraft journey log and he had not checked the aircraft before the flight. The flight school was negligent in failing to provide the student with adequate instructions regarding his flight."
46859,"During takeoff, the pilot lost directional control and the aircraft hit a snow bank and overturned."
46856,"The tachometer oscillated for a few moments and then indicated 0. The pilot, thinking that the engine had failed, made an autorotation and when he moved around the cockpit the aircraft rolled over. The investigation revealed that a tachometer cable was cut but that there had been no engine failure."
46850,"The aircraft hit a snowdrift located 75 feet before the runway on which it was nevertheless able to land. The pilot lost control of the aircraft, which veered off course and broke its left landing gear. The weather conditions at the time were conducive to the formation of a whiteout and the approach to the runway was not clearly indicated."
46848,"at a rate to the right during the takeoff roll. The pilot put full left foot and the plane left the runway, hitting a snowdrift and overturning."
46845,About 25 miles from the airport the pilot noticed a partial loss of power and engine overheating. About 1 mile from the airport the engine stopped completely. The pilot decided to land with a 10 mph tailwind. He miscalculated his approach and washed out of the runway and overturned into the snow-covered runway extension.
45878,"was leaving a tight spot and the rotor blades hit electrical wires. The pilot lost control of the aircraft, which landed hard."
45870,"After passing the high cone on the instrument approach, the engine lost power. The pilot could not locate the airport visually and quickly. He therefore decided to make a forced landing on a road. As the speed decreased, a wheel of the main landing gear cut a windrow, causing the aircraft to turn perpendicular to the road, seriously damaging it."
45869,co-pilot was at the controls at the time of landing on a snow-covered runway. the prevailing crosswinds were above the maximum allowable for a landing. shortly after touchdown the aircraft veered to the right and crashed into a snowdrift. the nose gear was torn off and the aircraft came to rest on its nose.
45868,"during a flight from edmonton to mont-joli the engine began to pump. the pilot then altered his route to land at a closer airport. the carburetor heat was on \""hot\"" and the mixture became lean. as soon as the heat was set to \""cold\"" without any enrichment of the mixture the engine stopped. the aircraft struck a snow fence during a forced landing on a road."
45867,"The pilot flew over his landing site and then turned downwind over the snow-covered lake without any landmarks. Flying downwind without being able to assess his altitude due to the whiteness of the snow, the pilot descended slowly and the plane hit the snowy surface."
45860,"After takeoff the left engine lost power. The pilot reduced power and attempted to land on the runway. After touchdown the aircraft veered left and went off the runway, crashing into a ditch."
45857,cruise flight the elevators froze due to water accumulating in the hull. on the first landing attempt the aircraft hit the runway at a steep angle which clipped the nose gear. on the second attempt the aircraft bounced violently the right wing tore off and the aircraft flipped over.
45850,"The pilot was in an extended downwind circuit when the engine stopped. The pilot then prepared to make a forced landing but as it became clear that he would never reach the field he had chosen, he pitched his aircraft up in the hope of extending the glide. The aircraft stalled and nose-dived vertically to the ground."
45847,that the pilot retracted the gear after takeoff he heard a loud noise. suspecting trouble he lowered his gear and asked for another pilot to fly next to him and check. the nose gear had jammed at a 45 deg angle. the pilot made a normal landing and the nose gear collapsed during taxiing. the nose gear door linkage was detached and the gear had jammed in the doors.
45844,having landed on water the pilot was traveling at high speed on the step at that time the wind was blowing in gusts. a gust of wind lifted the left wing and the right wing hit the water which seriously damaged it.
45836,was taking off in a gusty crosswind. At the time of takeoff the pilot noticed that the float rudder had come loose. He lost control of the direction and the aircraft turned over. The aircraft was equipped with an emergency locator transmitter which did not work.
45829,The pilot was flying a circuit around an unmarked airfield and was looking for the runway because he was running low on fuel. The engine stopped due to lack of fuel and the pilot made a forced landing in the shrubs bordering the airfield.
45824,was conducting an emergency evaluation flight and encountered bad weather. The flight continued in conditions of reduced visibility and the aircraft eventually crashed into a hill.
45820,takeoff the pilot had to make a turn to avoid an obstacle. during the turn the speed was too low the pilot was slow to apply the gas and was unable to prevent the stall.
45818,After takeoff the engine stopped and during the emergency landing the tail boom was sheared off. The engine failure was caused by a rupture of the compressed air line (part no. 6875631) at the flared end of the pressure tapping sleeve.
45817,The aircraft made an approach with too steep a slope and at too high a speed it bounced heavily after having cleared part of the runway. The pilot started a go-around and during the climb the right wing hit a tree; the aircraft crashed and caught fire.
45814,"was transporting fishermen to Lac des Deux-Montagnes and was to spend the night there, but the return to Matagami was delayed by two days due to bad weather. The pilot had left a note explaining his itinerary. The survivor stated that on the third day the pilot decided to go to Nemiscau and then return to Matagami. He also recalled that just before it crashed the aircraft was flying at the edge of the cloud base at low altitude and that visibility was reduced due to fog. Bad weather and a failure of the emergency locator transmitter considerably delayed the search. The survivor was found 11 days later. The pilot had little instrument training and was not competent to fly in such weather conditions. The fact that one of the passengers needed urgent medical attention may have prompted the pilot to take off."
45808,"Shortly after takeoff, the pilot aborted the manoeuvre because he believed the aircraft would not clear the runway markers. The aircraft veered off the runway and stopped in a field. The lack of acceleration was partly caused by a gradual power loss caused by a slip of the throttle and the excessive drag caused by the 30 degrees of flaps."
45804,"cruise the windshield of a float-mounted aircraft became covered with oil, thus obstructing the pilot's visibility. during the precautionary landing attempt the pilot executed a tight turn at low altitude and low speed in order to avoid an obstacle. the aircraft, to which a canoe and a sheet of plywood were attached, stalled and crashed to the ground almost vertically and out of control."
45802,During a spreading pass the windshield became covered in oil. The pilot tried in vain to clean it and during the skidding turn facing the sun the left wing hit the ground and the aircraft capsized and was completely destroyed.
45801,The pilot was flying low over a river to scout out the fields that were to be sprayed. The aircraft struck high-tension wires at floor level and despite the significant damage the pilot was able to keep the aircraft in the air for the 4 minutes it took to return to base.
45799,got caught in bad weather and then during a forced landing in a soft field it hit a fence.
45796,"The pilot used his aircraft to resupply fishing camps and occasionally to transport passengers between them. On the day of the accident, he flew to a camp on Kikwissi Lake, Quebec, to pick up three passengers and return them to his main base in Laniel. In the absence of witnesses, it is assumed that the aircraft arrived at Kikwissi Lake at 09:00 EDT and left shortly thereafter, probably with the three passengers. That morning, a severe thunderstorm was reported in the area. Local residents reported that the storm lasted 15 to 30 minutes and was followed by an abrupt change in wind direction. Pilots from a commercial airline have encountered thunderstorms in the same area that they were able to avoid. The weather conditions have been reconstructed and confirmed that the weather was not favourable for flying. The aircraft did not arrive at Laniel and a search operation was commenced. For three days, aerial searches were unsuccessful. On June 14, two fishermen found debris from the Cessna 180 in the southern part of Maclaren Bay, Lake Kipiwa. The pilot's jacket and logbook were also found, as were a fishing permit and another jacket identified as belonging to a passenger. Examination of the floats revealed that the aircraft had nose-dived into the water at high speed. A search was conducted in the southern part of the lake with sonar nets and divers; no bodies or wreckage were found. The nature of the lake bottom made the search difficult and probably inconclusive. Since there were no witnesses and the main wreckage was not found, it is impossible to reach any conclusions. It appears that the pilot loaded his three passengers as he intended and took off towards Laniel; during the flight he encountered adverse weather conditions. The pilot either lost control of the aircraft or attempted to land in very turbulent waters, an attempt that ended in an accident."
45795,The pilot was attempting to take off from a confined area that offered only one approach path and was located in a hilly area. The aircraft was near its maximum takeoff weight. The rotor failed and the pilot's attempts to recover were unsuccessful. It appears that the pilot increased the blade pitch too much. No mechanical failure was found.
45794,had landed and the passengers were getting out. As the front seat passenger exited the tail collapsed and the pilot quickly pushed the control column causing the mast to shear and the transmission mounts to break. The ground at the rear end of the skids was soft.
45792,"During a takeoff from runway 27, the pilot felt that the aircraft was not gaining enough speed and decided to abort the takeoff. He was unable to stop the aircraft, which left the runway and hit a pole."
45791,"During a water landing on a flat body of water, the pilot misjudged his altitude. The aircraft hit the body of water in a nose-down attitude and overturned."
45786,"The pilot's technique for landing on a shimmering body of water was to fly towards the shore and land as close to it as possible. However, upon touching the water, he lost control and applied the throttle again, but the aircraft was too close to the shore to avoid the trees."
45782,"After takeoff, the aircraft made a sharp left turn; it stalled and hit the ground at a nose-down angle of approximately 45 degrees."
45767,"On landing, the pilot retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps. The landing gear partially folded, causing significant damage."
45766,Once landed the plane slid to the right due to the crosswind. One of the skis got caught in a snow mixture and the landing gear leg was torn off.
45762,"Having been delayed for a long time by the weather, the pilot decided to continue his route even though he knew that the weather was unfavourable. He took off without a flight plan but did not arrive at his first landmark or his destination. The aircraft and its pilot are still missing."
45759,small lake offers only one possible takeoff direction because of the surrounding terrain and the pilot had to take off with a crosswind. the plane was unable to clear the trees after takeoff.
45753,During the cruise the aircraft's engine failed and during the hard landing that followed the landing gear collapsed.
45752,"takeoff the pilot changed his time to local to perform a navigation. in cruise mode the aircraft experienced engine problems and the pilot fearing a fuel failure decided to land on a road. in descent the aircraft hit high voltage wires, overturned and hit the ground tail first."
45748,"After takeoff, the pilot lost control of his aircraft, which hit the ground almost vertically."
45740,cut the throttle to simulate an engine failure at 3600 feet/sea. he reheated the fuel and the student began a 70 mph glide and selected his landing area. the student applied the throttle every 500 feet to warm up the engine. at 600 feet/sea he applied the throttle abruptly and the engine failed. after the impact the nose gear broke and the aircraft flipped forward.
45735,had been declared airworthy and new shock absorbers had been ordered to be installed to reduce the reported vibrations. The pilot continued to fly the aircraft at low speed to reduce the vibrations. During landing the vibrations became so severe that the pilot lost control of the aircraft.
114794,"The Robinson R-44 helicopter, registration C-GBSR, operated by Foxair Heliservice, was in the takeoff phase when the pilot struck an obstacle on the ground surface. With the wind behind him, the pilot maneuvered the aircraft into a headwind and the wind caused the aircraft to tilt dynamically forward. The pilot and the two passengers did not suffer any serious injuries. The ELT was operational from the moment of the rollover."
102120,The Clipper had left St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil around 10 a.m. to make a local flight that was supposed to last about 3 hours. The flight was a familiarization flight. The aircraft was reported missing at 3 p.m. and was found in a field at 11 p.m. The ultralight had crashed and then caught fire. The two occupants died.
100956,"The pilot of the wheeled Pegazenair took off from his private runway, which extends south over a shallow bay of the Ottawa River. It was the first flight of the year. The aircraft had been put back in storage during the previous winter. Shortly after takeoff at a height of 40 feet, the engine (a Continental C-85) misfired and lost power. The pilot made a forced landing in the river. The aircraft came to rest on its nose in four feet of water."
100949,"During the landing roll, the right wing of the C-150 lifted unexpectedly. The pilot lost control of the aircraft while trying to lower the wing. The aircraft skidded to the right and the left landing gear collapsed."
100270,"The pilot of the Cessna 150 had refueled before taking off from Baie Comeau to go to La Tuque. During the flight, the pilot, who had become lost, requested assistance from the Montreal control centre. 41 minutes later, believing he was running out of fuel, the pilot made a precautionary landing. The aircraft landed on a cleared field after 3 h 41 min of flight. The aircraft's fuel range was approximately 4 h 30 min. The operator's examination of the aircraft after the accident revealed that the tanks contained several gallons of fuel. During the landing, the engine mount was damaged and the right wing was bent. The pilot was not injured."
99849,"The PA-28-140 had landed without incident in a grassy field following an engine failure. After being satisfied that the aircraft had not suffered any damage, the owner of the aircraft decided to take off from the field. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft became airborne prematurely when it passed over a small mound of earth and fell back to the ground. The pilot then aborted the takeoff. The nose wheel tore off in a small ditch that crossed the aircraft's path."
97612,The pilot landed with the wheels down. The aircraft flipped over during landing. The two passengers exited through the front passenger door and the pilot through the pilot's door. The evacuation was carried out without difficulty.
97608,"The C-152 ran out of fuel and the pilot made a forced landing in a swamp. The aircraft flipped over when the wheels touched the ground. After visually checking the fuel in the aircraft's tanks during the pre-flight inspection at St-Hubert, the pilot estimated 3 hours of endurance. The aircraft's fuel gauges indicated a little less than half at takeoff. The aircraft's endurance is four hours. The aircraft had flown 2.3 hours the day before and had not been refueled before departure. The power loss occurred 1.7 hours after takeoff. The ELT activated on impact and the two occupants were evacuated by a SAR helicopter 4.5 hours after the accident."
97564,"During the approach to the heliport, the instructor cut the throttle to perform a surprise failure. The student pilot did not react correctly. The instructor took over the controls but too late to complete the autorotation. The aircraft somersaulted after the skis struck the ground. The helicopter came to rest on its right side. The occupants were not injured."
97562,"The Aeronca suffered a power loss of approximately 40% shortly after takeoff at approximately 50 feet above ground. The pilot made an emergency landing straight ahead in the trees. The aircraft was heavily damaged. Both occupants escaped unharmed. During the pre-flight inspection the pilot found 1/4 cup of water in the right tank, 1/4 cup of water in the left tank and 1/2 cup in the feeder tank. In addition, the aircraft had previously suffered a similar problem caused by fuel contamination."
96732,The Pelican pilot was turning to land on a dirt road. A sudden gust of wind caused him to lose control of the aircraft. The left wing struck the ground and the ultralight made a semi-circle before coming to rest on its belly. The unlicensed pilot suffered serious injuries.
94827,"During the approach to land west on Douglas Lake, the pilot of the PA-11 performed a go-around. During the climb, much of his attention was devoted to maintaining a constant surveillance of the landing area rather than executing the manoeuvre.

54275,having become airborne at a height of about three feet the seaplane was caught in a sudden gust of wind which lifted the left wing. the aircraft turned right and headed towards a rocky and wooded headland. realizing that he would not be able to clear the obstacles the pilot cut the throttle and landed. the front of the right float sank into the water and the aircraft overturned. the pilot who had six hours dual control on seaplanes and a total of fourteen hours on type felt that he was not adequately prepared to deal with the various situations encountered in bush flying. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot was inexperienced on the type of aircraft and on seaplanes. 2. the pilot lost directional control in a gust of wind. other established facts: -nil-
54272,pilot who had never flown this amateur-built aircraft wanted to determine the aircraft's handling on the ground. he accelerated but having reached too high a speed he unintentionally took off. he managed to make a circuit but during the final approach and landing he had difficulty controlling the aircraft. on touchdown the aircraft bounced and landed heavily. the main landing gear went through the wings. the pilot having overcorrected the aircraft bounced on landing. findings: established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot had no experience on this aircraft and took off unintentionally. 2. the pilot did not maintain the correct attitude on landing. 3. the aircraft landed heavily and the landing gear went through the wings. other established facts: -none-.
54257,a long float taxi in preparation for takeoff on rough water the pilot of the seaplane shut down the engine to drain the floats. he tried in vain to pump water from the left float but it remained dangerously low in the water. the pilot then restarted the engine to head for shore but about a thousand feet from shore he realized he would not reach it. he shut down the engine again and handed out life jackets to the passengers. shortly afterward the left float began to sink and the tip of the left wing touched the bottom of the lake in about 20 feet of water. two of the passengers swam to shore but the pilot and one of the passengers remained on the float still afloat. twelve hours later they also swam to shore. the investigation revealed that two closing caps of the left float were defective and caused the water leak into the two aft compartments of the float. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the two aft compartments of the left float were flooded due to a water leak caused by two defective closing caps. 2. the long circulation afloat with a tailwind aggravated the water leak. other established facts: -none-
54256,"having made a visual approach in calm winds, the pilot landed his conventional aircraft. the aircraft bounced and then touched the runway with its nose pointing slightly to the left; when it reached the edge of the runway, the pilot applied full power and fully applied the right brake. the aircraft continued its trajectory on the grass at the edge of the runway and then the right main landing gear was torn off. the aircraft banked onto the right wing and stopped. when the aircraft made contact with the runway, it began to roll. the corrective manoeuvres of the pilot, who had only limited experience with conventional aircraft, were not sufficient to ensure directional control of the aircraft. the roll was amplified when the pilot applied full power. Conclusions: Established facts relating to the causes: 1. The pilot had only limited experience with conventional aircraft. 2. Directional control of the aircraft was not ensured. 3. The aircraft bobbed. 4. The pilot's corrective manoeuvres amplified the bobbing. Other established facts: -none-"
54245,"The pilot climbed to an altitude of 4,500 feet asl but as the weather deteriorated he gradually descended to 700 feet asl to stay out of the clouds. He tried to make radio contact with Saint-Hubert and Dorval air traffic control to get help but his altitude was too low he was unable to establish radio contact. The pilot found himself surrounded by cumulonimbus clouds and, unable to divert to another aerodrome, he decided to make a precautionary landing in a field. During taxiing after landing, the nose gear broke off when it sank into the soft ground and the aircraft flipped over. Before taking off, the pilot had telephoned the Sherbrooke flight service station to find out the weather conditions. he was told that the forecast was favourable for vfr flight along his route and to his destination. he was also warned that fog, rain showers and thunderstorms sometimes reduced visibility. the pilot found himself in an area of ​​high thunderstorm activity and made a precautionary landing. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot continued his flight in poor weather conditions. 2. during the precautionary landing in a field the nose gear sank into the soft ground. other established facts: -none-"
54237,atmospheric conditions were conducive to the formation of carburetor icing. the pilot conducted his pre-takeoff checks and checked the operation of the carburetor heat while taxiing for one mile. he did not use carburetor heat for takeoff and initial climb. at 800 feet agl engine rpms decreased rapidly. unable to maintain altitude the aircraft struck trees and fell to the ground. the technical investigation determined that the loss of power was not due to mechanical failure and according to the pilot's statements there were no symptoms of mechanical failure. atmospheric conditions and the long taxi without carburetor heat probably led to the formation of carburetor icing. Shortly after take-off the engine power decreased rapidly and the pilot was forced to make a forced landing in the trees. Findings Established facts relating to the causes: 1. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to the formation of carburettor icing. 2. The pilot did not take the necessary precautions to avoid the formation of carburettor icing. Other established facts: -none-
54236,"pilot landed on a private runway where the crosswind force reached the maximum demonstrated limit speed (11 knots). during the landing roll a gust of wind caused the aircraft to deviate to the right. the pilot tried to bring it back on track by applying the left brake but the aircraft went off the side of the runway and struck a maintenance vehicle parked nearby. the damage to the left main landing gear made it impossible to establish whether the left brake was functioning at the time of the accident. the gust of more than 11 knots, thus exceeding the maximum demonstrated limit for a crosswind landing, did not allow the pilot to maintain directional control of his aircraft. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the wind gust exceeded the maximum demonstrated limit for a crosswind landing for this type of aircraft. 2. the aircraft yaw to the right. 3. the left brake was ineffective during the attempt to bring the aircraft back on track. 4. the aircraft collided with a vehicle that was parked near the runway. other established facts: -none-"
54233,had made several touch-and-go landings in a light crosswind. on the next landing he had difficulty holding the centreline while taxiing. the pilot believed that this difficulty was due to the fact that the nose wheel was carrying too much weight after touchdown. during the next landing he delayed touching down the nose wheel as long as possible. the aircraft left the runway and came to a stop after hitting a ditch. the pilot was unaware that the rudder pedals controlled the nose wheel deflection and that he could have controlled the direction of the aircraft using the nose wheel. his efforts at the controls were therefore ineffective in controlling the aircraft's course at low speed. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the pilot was unaware that the rudder pedals also controlled the nose wheel deflection. 2. as the front wheel did not touch the ground during taxiing the pilot was unable to hold the axle. other established facts: none.
54232,"The owner of the aircraft and his instructor had just finished a training session in the St-Hubert area and had landed for refueling. They mutually agreed that the session was over and the instructor took the left seat when departing from St-Hubert. After takeoff, the owner took the controls to practice flying in the right seat. As the aircraft entered the circuit for Runway 07 at Ste-Therese, the instructor in the left seat had taken over the controls. He then decided to simulate an engine failure by pulling the throttle back and he handed over the controls to the owner, who performed the approach. During the final turn, the owner felt that the aircraft was too high and, not feeling confident, he handed over the controls to the instructor. The latter decided to continue the approach and retracted the flaps. The aircraft touched down abruptly 350 feet before the displaced runway threshold and the left main landing gear was torn off. The investigation revealed that despite the end of the training session in accordance with the rules, the instructor had decided to put his student pilot to the test without having told him about the failure or having warned him of it. The student pilot therefore did not know what type of landing circuit he was supposed to perform. He did not believe he had the necessary skills to complete the circuit even after the instructor had performed the initial part. When the student handed over the controls on final, the aircraft was too high to perform a normal landing but the instructor tried to catch up with the approach rather than reflying a circuit. The retraction of the flaps caused a high rate of descent that the pilot was unable to correct. the aircraft had no technical defects before the accident and the failure of the landing gear was due only to overloading. this investigation resulted in laboratory report number lp 203/84 entitled main landing gear housing assembly. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the instructor had not informed the student pilot of a possible engine failure exercise. 2. the student pilot's approach placed the aircraft at too high an altitude on final. 3. the instructor who had taken over the controls retracted the flaps and despite the high rate of descent on final and the poor presentation of the aircraft did not attempt to apply the go-around. other established facts: -none-"
54231,"The pilot was preparing to make a landing and go-around on the 3,400-foot runway. Having started the descent too high and too close to the runway threshold, he had to make the approach on a steep slope. The nose wheel touched the runway the first 1,000 feet after the threshold and the aircraft began to porpoise. The porpoising continued until the pilot applied a go-around to stabilize the aircraft. He finally landed with only 800 feet of runway remaining. During the subsequent taxi, the pilot was debating whether to apply the go-around or stop the aircraft. He decided to apply full brakes with only 100 feet of runway remaining. The aircraft continued on the grass extension until it encountered a deep trench adjacent to the profiled surface. the flare was too slight to prevent the nose wheel from touching the runway, leading to porpoising. after stabilizing his aircraft, the pilot delayed the decision not to take off again until he was close to the end of the runway. this hesitation caused him to overshoot the runway and end up in a ditch. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the point chosen to begin the approach made a steep descent inevitable. 2. the flare was too slight. 3. the aircraft porpoised after the nose wheel touched the runway. 4. the pilot delayed the decision not to go around and stop the aircraft. 5. the aircraft overshot the runway and entered a ditch. other established facts: 1. the drainage pit does not comply with chapter 10 of tp 312 of transport canada relating to profiled surfaces bordering a runway."
54230,pilot was flying circuits on a private runway. during landing taxi he did not maintain his axis and the aircraft pivoted to the right and entered a drainage ditch. the right landing gear was torn off. since the pilot was not holding the control column far enough back there was not enough pressure on the tail wheel for him to have good directional control. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the pilot lost directional control because he was not holding the controls in a manner that would give him maximum efficiency. other established facts: -none-
54225,"made a hard landing on glassy water; it bounced and stalled. the right wingtip and right float struck the water and the aircraft flipped over. the investigation established that the aircraft had just been returned to service after winter and that the pilot had flown only once in the previous six months. not having recent experience with glassy water landings, the pilot stalled the aircraft after being surprised by the bounce. the pilot failed to correct the stall properly; the wing and float struck the water and the aircraft flipped over. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the pilot was making his first glassy water landing of the season. 2. the aircraft stalled after bouncing on landing. 3. the stall was incorrectly corrected and the aircraft overturned. other established facts: -none-"
54223,"pilot-builder wanted to test the airspeed indicator of the seaplane he was putting the finishing touches to. this test was to be done by taxiing at high speed on the surface of the water. the pilot placed the seaplane into the wind and then increased the power. the aircraft climbed onto the step and took off, gained about 20 feet and began a slow left turn. the pilot cut the throttle and maintained the turn so as to land in the opposite direction to the takeoff. during the manoeuvre the left wing tip touched the water; the seaplane was thrown onto the float stops and onto its nose and then rolled over onto its back before coming to a stop in shallow water. the pilot had no experience on this type of aircraft and had no intention of undertaking a flight that day. to test the anemometer while taxiing on the surface of the water the pilot used a power setting which with the headwind was sufficient to get the aircraft off the ground. concentrating on the airspeed indicator the pilot did not immediately become aware of the takeoff. because of the propeller torque the aircraft began a left turn. wanting to land as soon as possible the seaplane which he had never handled in flight the pilot cut the throttle continued the left turn and attempted a downwind landing. still being tilted near the surface the aircraft struck the water with the wingtip. the violent yaw movement which followed caused the seaplane to spin around. conclusions established facts relating to the causes: 1. the pilot had no experience on the type of seaplane in question. 2. while flying at high speed against the wind on the surface of the water, the seaplane inadvertently took off and began a left turn. 3. having become aware of the take-off, the pilot cut the throttle and continued the turn to land downwind; during the turn the left wing tip struck the surface of the water and the aircraft pirouetted. other established facts: -none-"
54219,"pilot and a friend took off late in the afternoon for a fishing trip the next day. several friends and relatives were aware of their intentions but did not know their destination. they did not file a flight plan. the following day, since they had not returned, a friend conducted a search flight and discovered the wreckage of the aircraft on a frozen lake. the investigation revealed that the aircraft, banked to the right and in a nose-down attitude, had struck the surface of the lake. the tip of the right wing had come into contact with the ice first, followed simultaneously by the two skis and the engine. the aircraft then rolled around the left wing and slid for 50 feet before stopping. no mechanical defects were discovered on the wreckage. the pathological examination found that the blood alcohol levels of the pilot and passenger were 0.14% and 0.13% respectively. according to the police laboratory guidelines for the interpretation of blood alcohol levels, it is very likely that a person with such levels could be impaired. the attitude of the aircraft at impact and the very short track left by the wreckage on the ice suggest that the aircraft stalled at low altitude. findings established facts relating to causes: 1. the pilot's blood alcohol level was 0.14%. 2. the pilot's abilities were probably impaired by the high percentage of alcohol in his blood. 3. the aircraft stalled at low altitude. other established facts: 1. the passenger had a blood alcohol level of 0.13%."
53448,"During a high-speed taxi test on the runway, the ultralight aircraft took off. The left wing sank and the pilot, unable to correct the problem with the controls, increased engine power to avoid trees. The left wing hit a tree and the aircraft pivoted to the left; then it stalled and fell into the trees."
53313,short final the pilot's visibility was limited by a light snowfall. the landing gear struck a snow bank about 30 feet before the runway threshold and then another 40 feet further down the runway. after touchdown the right landing gear collapsed and the wing and propeller were damaged. according to the pilot he was unexpectedly hampered by a whiteout effect on short final.
53310,took off with a full tank of fuel. two hours and thirty minutes later and 2 miles from its destination the aircraft's engine stopped. the pilot made a forced landing in a field. the nose and left landing gear were damaged when the aircraft passed over a rough surface. an examination of the fuel system determined that there was no usable fuel on board and that the carburetor was set too rich. the pilot stated that it was not until after two hours of flight that he noticed the high fuel consumption. he leaned the mixture but he already had not enough fuel to reach the destination. findings established facts relating to the causes: 1. the mixture was set too rich. 2. the pilot did not monitor his fuel consumption. 3. the engine ran out of fuel. 4. the terrain chosen for the forced landing was uneven. other established facts: -none-
53286,nose gear collapsed shortly after landing on a short gravel runway. investigation found that the end of the actuator piston had flexed due to overload. there was no further damage to the nose gear and its housing so it is believed that the nose gear was not locked. the pilot stated that all three green lights were illuminated and that he had visually verified that the nose gear was down.
53284,the takeoff run from a short straight line of a forest road the pilot picked up the microphone to make a radio transmission. when he took his hand off the throttle the rpm began to drop because the throttle grip was not adjusted. he applied the throttle again to take off but did not correct a yaw movement to the left. the aircraft struck shrubs and a ditch.
53272,"Having encountered thunderstorms on his route, the pilot decided to return to his starting point. Eight miles from the intended destination, the engine ran out of fuel. The pilot established a circuit in order to make a forced landing in a clearing, but just before touching down, the left wing hit a tree trunk and the aircraft capsized."
53254,"While taxiing after landing, the pilot saw a person standing at the edge of the runway. It is not certain why the plane flipped over, but it may be that the pilot, distracted by the person, braked too hard."
53250,The pilot was turning left in preparation for takeoff when the right landing gear collapsed. The bolt securing the landing gear to the fuselage had broken for reasons that could not be determined.
53243,"freezing rain had fallen all night but the airport manager had assured the crew that the runway would be sanded. this had already been done four hours before the aircraft arrived and two more loads were to be spread. unfortunately delayed by slippery road conditions the trucks were unable to deliver the sand in time. the runway was icy following continuous showers which lasted almost three hours before the aircraft arrived without the crew being informed of the situation. the captain contacted his destination about 15 minutes before landing and was advised of the following conditions: visibility good runway sand braking poor to fair wind 195 to 210 degrees at 7 to 10 kt and runway 27 in use. the aircraft was in the final turn when the operations agent advised the crew that the runway was slippery, the wind was 210 degrees at 5 kt and he added that the aircraft should stay on the sand side. on short final the captain noted that the runway appeared very slippery. after touchdown the crew retracted the flaps and applied the thrust reverser. the aircraft began to deviate to the right the pilot tried to stop this movement by means of asymmetric thrust. the aircraft, upon hitting a snowbank, lost the right landing gear and came to rest on the right wing and the left landing gear some 210 feet beyond the snowbank."
53237,"The pilot was following the route to his destination when he made a short detour to inspect some fishing huts. He began the approach at 60 mph at a descent rate of 400 and 500 fpm. Shortly before reaching the ice surface, the right shock absorber made contact at right angles with a power cable that crossed the river at a height of 45 ft. The pilot pulled the cyclic control back to stop the aircraft in its tracks; in doing so, a main rotor blade struck the cable and separated, causing the main rotor to become unbalanced; the helicopter fell and sustained substantial damage."
52335,"crosswind landing a gust of wind lifted the left wing. the tip of the right wing and the right float hit the water. the pilot applied power and pitched the aircraft up but the tail, then the float and the left wing hit the water."
52320,avoiding the rocks near the shore the pilot landed in the center of the lake on the shimmering water. unfortunately he did not make the right type of approach and when he made contact with the water the nose and left wing were tilted downwards. the pilot immediately pulled hard on the stick; the tip of the right wing hit the water. during the landing the left float the fuselage and the right wing were damaged.
52316,During a night landing the pilot had difficulty judging his altitude above the runway. He applied the throttle to abort the landing but became disoriented and lost control of his aircraft. The aircraft crashed 200 feet beyond the right side of the runway.
52301,cruise the engine lost power. the pilot applied carburetor heat which did not work and decided to make a forced landing on a lake below him. on final approach the engine restarted and the pilot applied full power to abort the landing but the rate of climb was insufficient to clear the tree line. the right wing struck a tree and the aircraft yawped to the right. still having control of the aircraft the pilot made a forced landing but on touchdown the aircraft bounced nose-down in the water and came to rest on its back. the weather conditions and the behavior of the engine favored carburetor icing.
52294,"Four minutes after takeoff, the pilot radioed that he was returning to base due to high cylinder head temperatures. A few seconds later, the engine lost power. During the final turn toward the lake, the left wing struck the tops of the trees; the pilot lost control of the aircraft, which crashed into the water. The pilot had not flown for 6 months and was performing his first job of the season. The technical examination confirmed the integrity of the controls and the wing. The laboratory examination of the engine and its accessories revealed several anomalies; however, none could have caused the failure. Among these, two connecting rods were found to be out of order, as well as two spark plugs, a magneto and a cracked piston. During testing, the carburetor was found to be in working order, although the mixture setting was too lean, which may have caused the cylinder temperature to be too high. (LP 167/82 LP 175/82 and Aero Standard Report) The probable cause of the engine failure was attributed to the engine-driven fuel pump; this did not work during testing. The pump was dismantled without revealing anything abnormal. Once reassembled, it worked normally. The failure of the first test could not be explained."
52286,After takeoff in cruise at 1000 feet the aircraft suffered a partial loss of power. Unable to return to the point of departure the pilot decided to make a precautionary landing in a field. Shortly after touchdown the aircraft struck a mound of earth on which the landing gear failed. Post-accident inspection found that the spark plug gap was too large and the right magneto oil seal was defective. These failures may have been a contributing factor to the partial loss of power.
52277,"During the approach, the pilot noticed that the landing gear position indicator lights were not lighting up; however, he considered that this failure was caused by a defect in the instrument lighting circuit. With the landing gear in the down position, the pilot continued the landing. After the wheels touched down, the aircraft rolled for a short distance and then the landing gear retracted to the 1/3 down position. During the maneuver, the propeller tips, the landing gear doors and the antenna were damaged. The inspection following the accident did not reveal the cause of the landing gear failure."
52275,was traveling on a narrow track with a strong gusty wind blowing from behind. the left landing gear entered a snowdrift causing the airplane to pivot to the left; the nose wheel hit the snow bank and the airplane went into a pylon resting on the right wing. a gust of wind caused it to roll over onto its back.
52267,while taxiing on the ground the right ski hit a hardened snow bank and the right landing gear broke at the point of attachment to the fuselage. laboratory examination revealed that this breakage was produced by two small fatigue cracks originating from deep and extensive corrosion points. (rp 79/82)
51380,The pilot was heading towards his take-off point when the right ski and then the left ski went through the ice. The plane sank until the wings resting on the ice held it up.
51378,"the engine stopped during the climb and the pilot tried to return to his starting point. however he was unable to reach the airport and crashed into trees shortly before the runway. after the accident inspection revealed that de-icing fluid was in the fuel. the pilot had not purged the hand pump used for the de-icing fluid sufficiently, having to use the same pump to refuel his aircraft."
51371,"The pilot was flying touch-and-go landing circuits in gusty winds. On final, the aircraft stalled about 50 feet and struck the marshy ground 100 feet short of the runway threshold. The landing gear collapsed and the aircraft overturned."
51366,At the moment of landing a gust of wind caused the aircraft to swing to the left. The left wheel hit a mound of earth before the pilot could apply power and the aircraft came to a stop in a small ditch.
51362,"After takeoff, witnesses heard the engine cough sporadically before stopping completely. They saw the aircraft land in a left banked and nose-down position. The left float plunged violently, causing the aircraft to flip over and sink until only the floats were visible. The pilot and passenger drowned. Analysis of fuel samples revealed that water in the fuel caused the engine failure."
51355,a charter flight to transport cargo to a lake located about 60 miles from the base the pilot was flying between 300 and 400 feet in a thin layer of fog with reduced visibility of about 4 miles. as the weather conditions deteriorated he decided to gain altitude by flying through the layer. during the climb the left wing tip caught the top of a tree. the pilot was able to maintain control of the aircraft and return to base. subsequent inspection revealed significant damage to the wing tip.
51339,"After takeoff at an altitude of about 100 feet, the pilot, who was carrying a load of insecticide, realized that his engine was not developing its full power. The pilot dumped part of his load and as the aircraft continued to sink, he dumped more fuel but was unable to stop the descent. The aircraft landed on soft ground and overturned. The pilot had to be helped out because he was stuck inside his aircraft, which took a few minutes. The investigation showed that the lack of engine power was due to fuel contamination."
51334,while cruising the engine suddenly stopped. the pilot initiated an autorotation but misjudged his approach to the intended landing point. in order to avoid the trees on the edge of the swamp he pitched up also reducing the rpm and speed resulting in a hard landing. on impact the left cross member broke and the main rotor sheared the tail boom. technical inspection revealed that the turbine flameout was caused by the disconnection of the turbine-compressor coupling and the turbine spline adapter. this disconnection resulted from excessive wear of the splines probably caused by poor lubrication and/or by contamination of abrasive particles in the contact area of ​​the splines.
51321,cruise the engine stopped and the pilot attempted to make a forced landing on a small lake. the approach was made too high and at high speed and the pilot touched down in the middle of the lake. the remaining distance to stop being insufficient and arriving at the end of the lake he pulled back on the controls to avoid obstacles he took off a short distance hit trees and stopped inverted 250 feet from the lake shore. during the investigation it was discovered that the engine crankshaft had failed under fatigue. this internal crack in the crankshaft had not been caused by overload. the cause of the fatigue crack could not be determined although it appears to have originated from an internal metal flaw.
51320,"Pilot reported a loss of power while climbing after a touch-and-go. Unable to avoid the electrical wires in his path, he turned right to make a forced landing on an adjacent field. The aircraft fell sharply and struck the ground with its left wing and nose before overturning."
51307,approaching the first stop en route the right engine stopped. after feathering the pilot landed the aircraft on one engine. engine checks on the ground revealed no serious anomalies and after a short flight test everything seemed normal. nevertheless the captain decided to return to his home base. just after takeoff the right engine once again lost power and the propeller was feathered. simultaneously the captain noticed a drop in the intake pressure of the left engine. unable to maintain his altitude he was therefore forced to land on a road on the edge of the airport. the aircraft landed on its belly because the pilot had taken too long to extend the landing gear. the latter did not have time to extend completely. both engines operated normally during their check and the fuel was not contaminated. The reasons for the loss of power of both engines could not be determined.
51305,cruising at 1000 ft/gl and at an indicated airspeed of 100 knots the pilot reported a loss of engine torque. on final autorotation the pilot flared too early the helicopter sank and crashed.
51301,visual inspection of the aircraft between flights revealed that a main landing gear mounting bracket was broken. the pilot sought advice from an airport maintenance department where he was told that if he took off and landed smoothly he would have no problem. this advice was then passed on to a superior who told the pilot to have the aircraft repaired at another airport. at destination during taxiing after landing the left landing gear collapsed. according to the technical logs the brackets were replaced at the 1000 hour inspection whereas a microscopic examination indicates that the bracket was not new and had not been replaced. if the part had not been replaced it would have been a good idea to carry out an m.p.1 inspection following the manufacturer's standards although this is not mandatory. the crack not having been detected it is believed that this inspection was not carried out or was carried out incorrectly because the defect was discovered only 52 hours later during a simple visual inspection.
51291,After takeoff the engine stopped due to lack of fuel. The pilot made a forced landing during which a shock absorber and the side of the fuselage were damaged. The pilot admitted that he had not visually checked the amount of fuel in the tanks but had relied on the fuel indicators.
51289,the unlicensed pilot was giving flying lessons on his autogyro (which was not registered) to a prospective buyer. the machine was towed by a car on a public road. the owner flew the aircraft during the first flight while the buyer followed the movement of the controls. during the second take-off the buyer had the controls and during towing the autogyro began to oscillate sideways the tow bar came loose from its hitch on the car the autogyro tilted to the right and its rotor struck the ground.
51287,"After takeoff in a 90 degree crosswind at 10 knots the aircraft drifted off the runway. The pilot lost control of the aircraft and aborted the flight by closing the throttle. The aircraft landed and stopped in a ditch parallel to the runway causing significant damage to the forward fuselage, main landing gear and propeller. This was the first time the pilot had flown an aircraft with conventional landing gear."
51286,"was training the student to fly circuits. the instructor had warned the student and after takeoff he simulated an engine failure. the student did not react properly and before the instructor could take control the aircraft stalled and landed hard on the right landing gear. the right landing gear compass leg failed and the wheel went to 90 degrees. this leg had been subjected to rapid cycle, low stress fatigue and finally failed during the hard landing. the investigation revealed that the instructions in ad 67-20-40 (april 20 67) and piper special letter #248 (but 67) regarding inspection and replacement of landing gear compasses had not been followed. (lp 150/81)"
51284,to accommodate his passengers the pilot landed his helicopter between a high-voltage power line pylon and guy wires. the passengers returned 40 minutes later and the pilot prepared his aircraft for departure. on takeoff he applied left rudder while monitoring a cable to his left. the helicopter moved forward slightly and the pilot heard a bang followed by cracking. the main rotor blades had struck a guy wire on the right of the aircraft. the helicopter fell to the ground and stopped on its left side. the distance between the cables was 48 feet while the main rotor diameter was 34 feet and 8 inches.
51283,"was using a different type of aircraft from the one he had trained on to date. During taxiing after landing the aircraft began to roll to the left and the pilot corrected it by applying his right foot. As the rudder pedals appeared ineffective, he used the right brake and the aircraft rolled to the right and tipped onto its nose. The propeller and tail were damaged."
51277,"The student pilot landed without permission on a frozen lake to visit fishermen. During takeoff, the pilot lost control of the aircraft when the nose wheel hit a frozen snowdrift. The right wing grazed the snow surface and the pilot made an excessive correction, causing the left wing to hit the ice. The pilot reduced the throttle and regained control of his aircraft. Although the aircraft had suffered significant damage, it was able to be flown back to base."
51276,"During a ski landing on a frozen lake, the aircraft was blown towards the coast by a strong crosswind. The left wing was damaged after hitting a tree."
51274,Right landing gear collapsed after landing. The aircraft lurched to the right and ended up in an irrigation ditch. Investigation revealed that a deformed push-pull rod prevented the right landing gear from fully extending.
51256,showed his student the technique of takeoff and landing on crusted snow. during a takeoff he put the helicopter into translation but the left skid remained stuck under a thicker layer of snow. the pilot then focused his attention on the detail and when the left skid finally came free the right skid in turn got stuck under a snow bank. the aircraft lay on its right side before the instructor had time to react.
50276,at the end of a night vfr flight the pilot made a steep approach and at a higher than normal speed. he was slow to make his flare the nose gear collapsed and the propeller struck the runway. when the main wheels touched down the aircraft bounced. the pilot regained control of the aircraft but on the second landing the aircraft slid off the runway. the pilot was known to have constant difficulty with his approaches and landings.
50274,vfr flight the pilot encountered heavy snowfall reducing visibility by at least 1/4 mile. fifteen minutes from his destination he saw two trucks parked on the shoulder of a forest road and he reduced his speed and began a left turn. out of control the aircraft continued the left turn until it struck trees. the pilot thought he had lost the tail rotor but the technical examination did not confirm this failure (lp 349/80 lp 348/80 lp 344/80). it is assumed that the pilot lost his visual references and became disoriented from the start of the turn.
50268,The pilot took off in heavy snowfall with reduced visibility. Five minutes later at low altitude he found himself in whiteout conditions while flying over a lake and lost all visual reference with the ground. While trying to return to shore the helicopter hit the surface of the lake.
50267,"Having made an approach in light freezing drizzle, the pilot allowed the sink rate to increase excessively on landing. The aircraft landed hard enough that the right propeller blades scraped the ground and the airframe sustained significant damage. Subsequent inspection found a 5/8 inch thick layer of ice on the defrosters and ice accumulation on other parts of the airframe."
50259,"275 ft landing run over a farm field the aircraft slowly rolled over into an inverted position. the aircraft was slowed down too quickly by the tall grass, soft ground and uphill slope. the pilot partially extinguished the fire that broke out with the on-board fire extinguisher. a farmer used his tractor's portable fire extinguisher to finish extinguishing the fire. the pilot had examined the field on foot a month before the accident and considered it usable."
50252,"was practicing touch-and-go. While going around, the plane went off the runway, hit a sandbank and flipped over. The student pilot advised that the runway (60 ft wide) was too narrow for pilot training."
50250,"Rain and low ceilings had delayed departure from a camp 82 miles into the woods. At 0800 the operations manager learned that the weather at the destination was improving but the weather at the departure point prohibited any departure. Shortly after 1000 the pilot and operations manager decided to attempt takeoff but if the weather conditions continued to be poor the pilot would have to turn back immediately. No weather information could be obtained from the area weather office. However, five other parties were waiting for the aircraft to depart. After 10 minutes of flight and at about 1000 ft agl the aircraft entered light rain which soon became heavy combined with severe turbulence. The pilot continued and the aircraft rapidly lost altitude. The pilot then entered a right turn during which the right wing struck the trees and the aircraft crashed. An analysis of the weather conditions indicated that thunderstorms were in the area and that the loss of control of the aircraft was caused by downdrafts associated with the thunderstorms. The pilot and front passenger suffered head and chest injuries on impact caused by improper harness retention. The passenger died of his injuries three hours later. The other three passengers were seated on a chipboard placed between two seats and without any harness. Only the passenger seated in the center suffered serious head injuries. Unaware that they were near a road and about 20 minutes from the camp, one of the passengers went through the woods to search for help. Help arrived about 4.5 hours later. while he was instructing the pilot had already had an accident in 1978. he had failed the private pilot exam three times, once the commercial pilot exam and twice the instructor pilot exam. he had also failed the instructor qualification flight following his first accident for the same reason as the accident, i.e. he did not keep the engine warm during the forced landing approach."
50245,The seaplane was operating with a tailwind of 12 to 17 mph (pilot's estimate) when a gust of wind lifted the tail and lowered the right wing. The aircraft continued to roll and flipped onto its back. The pilot and passengers were able to evacuate the seaplane without injury. The aircraft was supported by its floats and towed to shore.
50243,"was carrying two moose carcasses, eight quarters and a head with antlers were inside the aircraft, while the second head and its plume were attached to the front of the right float. The strong winds, which were blowing in gusts, raised two-foot waves. The cross-checking of the statements of a witness who heard the seaplane land and the analysis of the damage allows us to conclude that the aircraft bounced, lost a wing, struck the water in a nose-down attitude and that it turned over on its back before sinking."
50242,After about fifteen minutes of flight the engine began to cough and lose power. Unable to maintain altitude the pilot landed in a small bay. While doing a preliminary inspection of the engine the owner reported finding a piece of metal in cylinder #1.
50239,"five minutes from the destination airport the engine stopped due to running out of fuel. the pilot tried to restart it while heading towards a clearing. during the approach the left wing struck trees and the left float collapsed on contact with the ground. the pilot had put 20 gallons of fuel in the tanks and had made at least 5 flights of about 30 minutes each during the afternoon. the right fuel gauge was in the \red\"" while the left still indicated 2 needle widths when the engine stopped. after the accident both tanks were found completely empty. """
50235,The pilot stated that he began to abort his approach because he saw driftwood on the surface of the lake. During the go-around the speed continued to drop and the aircraft entered a spin and struck the water surface right wing first.
50230,"The pilot had just made an ""ils"" approach and landing in a crosswind in heavy rain showers. A few seconds after landing the left landing gear collapsed and the aircraft fell onto its left wing. Subsequent landing gear tests revealed no anomalies."
50229,"was carrying a load of aluminum surveying rods on a sling attached at one end only. As it approached its destination, the load began to spin. The unattached end fanned out. One of the rods came loose and struck the tail rotor. One of the tail rotor blades came loose and the other twisted. The pilot attempted to autorotate but was unable to prevent the helicopter from spinning. The helicopter crashed into the trees and sustained substantial damage."
50228,"During the go-around after an aborted landing, the pilot entered a steep left turn while climbing. The engine then stopped, the aircraft stalled, hit trees and power lines and came to rest inverted. The technical investigation revealed that the engine had run out of fuel."
50208,cruise flight approximately 35 miles from destination the aircraft engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion. the pilot prepared to make a forced landing at cedars airport. he made a tailwind approach that was too high and too fast for such a landing. at the last moment he attempted to turn into the wind and land on a taxiway. the aircraft stalled near the surface and landed hard flat in the field between the runway and the taxiway. the pilot was unaware that the aircraft had flown for 1.9 hours since its last refueling. the pilot could have conveniently chosen mirabel airport for his forced landing but he believed he did not have permission to land there because he was not instrument rated.
50205,"Engines gradually lost power after takeoff and the pilot had to land on a nearby lake. The crew was found by a helicopter that was immediately dispatched to the scene. The Islander had been refueled with Jet A-1 fuel. The refueling attendant, who was unfamiliar with this type of aircraft, had assumed that it was equipped with turboprops. The aircraft was parked in front of the Jet A-1 and 100/130 fuel pumps, which despite the indications were identical and side by side. The crew was eating in a restaurant while refueling and the pilot did not realize that the number \650\"" on the receipt indicated kerosene. He had complete confidence in the attendant, whom he had known for a very long time. The pilot had not given any instructions or directions to the attendant, who had not asked for any, and there was no marking on the aircraft specifying the type of fuel to be used."
50199,landing on a small lake in a right crosswind of 10 to 15 mph the pilot touched down very close to the shore and at about half the usable distance. shortly after touchdown he was unable to counter a swerve to the right. the right float struck floating tree trunks and the right wing struck trees. the airframe was seriously damaged in the accident.
50198,beginner was performing landings and takeoffs under the supervision of his instructor. following a normal approach for the fifth landing he failed to remain aligned with the runway centreline while taxiing. the aircraft left the runway and overturned on the ploughed surface of the adjacent field.
50197,During takeoff a strong gust of wind lifted the right wing of the plane as it took off. The left wing hit the water and the plane capsized.
50191,"Following a long spring thaw, the airline's flight dispatch department instructed the crew to land on an unsuitable gravel runway. During taxiing, the main landing gear sank into the soft surface and the nose gear broke under the deceleration force it had to withstand. The aircraft came to rest on its nose and propellers."
50190,"The pilot took off from a small lake in light winds. As it passed the shore, the plane hit the treetops in a nose-up attitude at a speed of about 60 knots. The aircraft was not overloaded and the engine was giving its normal power, but the downwinds on the shore of the lake prevented the plane from crossing the treetops."
50187,"During the pre-flight check, the pilot discovered hydraulic fluid on the ground. He checked the lines and found nothing serious. After takeoff, he retracted the landing gear but did not get a \""gear up\"" indication. He then made several gear selections but in vain. He therefore decided to divert to Val d'Or where he knew he could benefit from emergency equipment. He extended the emergency gear but did not get a \""locked in the down position\"" indication. During landing, the aircraft traveled some distance before the left landing gear retracted. The aircraft stopped on the left side of the runway and on the tip of the left wing. The investigation revealed that the landing gear activation mechanism was leaking and that the emergency CO2 bottle was almost empty."
50180,had left with a full tank and landed at his destination 3 hours and 52 minutes later. Five days later the pilot checked the fuel level and since he could not get any where he was he decided to fly to Sept-Iles to refuel 30 miles away. On approach his engine stopped due to a fuel shortage and he had to land in a clearing just before reaching the runway.
50177,"The pilot was conducting a soft-field landing exercise. Upon touchdown, the right landing gear separated due to a fracture of the retaining bolt. The aircraft came to rest on its right wing. The investigation determined that the failure of the AN-7-25-A bolt was caused by high-frequency, low-stress fatigue imposed by tensile and bending forces. The overload occurred after the crack had extended over 90% of the bolt section. It was determined that the bolt was torqued below the recommended value of 450 to 500 inch-pounds and that normal loads had caused the fatigue. The manufacturer recommends replacing the original bolt with a long MS2007-32 bolt that can be torqued to 650 to 700 inch-pounds. This higher tension, combined with a better shape, makes it more resistant to fatigue. In 1977 one of the previous owners replaced it with an An-7-25A because it was easier to install. (lp 131/80)"
50168,struck an unmarked power line across a river and then crashed into the snowy surface. The pilot was performing a forced landing exercise and did not see the two-wire line connected to a cottage on the other side of the river.
50167,during its breakthrough while completing an ifr flight the aircraft began to ice up. the pilot obtained clearance to land and lowered the landing gear. the three green lights came on to indicate that the landing gear was down and locked. after touchdown rather than setting the flaps up the pilot raised the landing gear and immediately lowered it. this incorrect selection lasted long enough to unlock the nose gear which partially retracted. the pilot then applied full throttle to keep the nose in the air and allow the hydraulic pressure to extend the landing gear. unfortunately the weight of the aircraft was already acting on the front of the fuselage and was too high for the control jack. both propellers therefore scraped the runway and the aircraft skidded on its nose for 150 feet before coming to a stop.
50163,"The pilot had delayed takeoff for a few minutes to allow a snow shower to subside before undertaking a short charter flight. Shortly after takeoff, visibility deteriorated rapidly and snow showers lowered the ceiling. Unable to turn around or continue, the pilot prepared to make a precautionary downwind landing on a snow-covered lake, using the shade of the trees on the shore as a reference. During the flare, a gust of wind lifted the aircraft's tail and it came to rest on its nose. An airline otter rescued the occupants approximately ten hours later. Bad weather caused by a cold front had been forecast. An analysis of the weather conditions indicated the possibility of wind shear at the time of the accident."
50159,made a low-altitude pass followed by a very pronounced low-speed recovery. he stalled and went into a spin. he crashed onto the ice without any recovery attempt being made. a fishing competition was taking place on the lake and it appears that the pilot wanted to make an impromptu aerial presentation.
50152,"on skis was on the snow at the edge of the runway and in a tailwind. while he was waiting for another plane to land a gust lifted the rear and made him fall on his back. the pilot was in the front seat while on this type of aircraft it is clearly specified: \solo flight rear seat only\""."
50150,During a takeoff from an intersection at a height of 15 feet the engine lost power. The pilot decided to abort the takeoff and landed on the runway. After touchdown the aircraft slid on the ice and overshot the end of the runway where it came to rest in a snow bank. The aircraft in question had been used several times during the day when temperatures were around -20 degrees C. With this extreme cold one would expect ice crystals to form in the fuel but on this day no one had added isopropyl alcohol to the fuel tanks. It is therefore assumed that the loss of engine speed was caused by an accumulation of ice crystals in the fuel lines.
49175,"the pilot was a student in the flying course at the chicoutimi cegep. he was returning from a month's leave and had been assigned to a solo flight exercise that included tight turns, avoidance manoeuvres, spirals and forced landings. there were eight other school aircraft flying solo at the same time in the training area. the collision occurred when the aircraft passed under another school aircraft that was returning from a solo cross-country flight. the cockpit ceiling was torn off and the vertical stabilizer clipped the fuselage of the other aircraft. both aircraft became uncontrollable and crashed."
49168,The helicopter was moving forward after takeoff. The tail rotor struck a piece of wood covered with 5 inches of powder snow. The pilot felt strong vibrations and landed immediately. The snow swirls had greatly reduced visibility.
49165,"Following a night flight, the pilot left the taxiway to return to his docking position. Once he had left the taxiway, the aircraft's right wing struck the unlit fuel pump canopy. At the time of the accident, the taxiway, surrounding buildings and the fuel pump area were in darkness."
49164,a power line surveillance the pilot after several requests from his passenger decided to demonstrate an aotorotation. at the time of the flare the tail skid struck a snow-covered tree stump which caused the helicopter to tilt forward. the main rotor blades then struck the tail boom and cut it. when the pilot tried to land the helicopter the right skid touched the ground surface and tore off. the helicopter then rolled onto its right side.
49157,"During the approach for a water landing, the pilot reported that despite displaying full power, his aircraft was losing altitude. The latter hit a power line and crashed approximately 400 feet from the lake."
49153,"motor glider had been loaned to the gliding club for technical evaluation purposes. at approximately 1150 hours the club president took off at the controls of the aircraft to demonstrate its performance to the chief instructor. after taking off on runway 14 the glider flew to the south of the runway where it was observed to make medium and tight turns. approximately five minutes later the aircraft flew over the middle of the runway on a heading of 050 degrees and at approximately 300 feet agl. it appeared to be joining the circuit for landing on runway 14. it was observed to enter a gradual left turn at an angle of bank of approximately 10 degrees. as the aircraft approached the threshold of runway 14 from abeam it banked to the right and then entered a spin in the same direction. there appeared to be a loss of engine speed at this time. After about 1 1/2 turns to the right the glider appeared to recover momentarily and then the throttle was applied again. However, the roll motion resumed and the aircraft disappeared behind some trees. The spoilers are actuated by arms attached by clamping rings to torque tubes which extend them into the aerodynamic downwash. Investigation revealed that most of these arms were not securely attached to the torque tubes and that the torque tubes bore traces of oil. Together these factors reduced the loads that could be applied before the arms slipped on the shafts. The voids between the wing spars and the spoiler panels contained accumulations of foreign matter which were identified as mouse nests. When the glider began its roll to the right the pilot was probably carrying out pre-landing checks. The spoilers appear last on the check runway. If a foreign object had lodged under any part of the right spoiler panel at the time of its deployment, the arms, because they were not properly secured, would likely have slid onto the torque tube when the pilot attempted to retract the spoilers, which would have allowed the right spoiler to remain partially or fully extended. Such an asymmetry would probably explain the uncontrolled rolling movement that was observed. As the airframe had been moved before the investigator arrived on site, the position of the spoiler at the time of impact could not be determined with certainty. A bolt used to attach the push-pull rod to the elevator was not as specified by the aircraft manufacturer but was not one of the causes of the accident."
49151,pilot was on the last of three test flights (for which he held a flight permit) in order to renew his c of n. after more than 2 1/2 hours of flight while descending below 2000 feet to base the #1 connecting rod bolt failed due to a bearing seizing caused by the intense heat from lack of oil. the connecting rod then broke and the engine seized. the pilot made a forced landing in a field and struck a fence at 30 mph. it was later determined that oil had leaked from the bottom stud of the #1 cylinder.
49144,a vfr navigation that included two intermediate landings the pilot was unable to find his destination airport. the engine ran out of fuel while the pilot was en route to another airport. he lost directional control during a forced landing without flaps in a farm field and the aircraft ended up in a ditch. although the aircraft had been flying for over an hour after refueling the pilot had not refueled at the time of departure because the gauges indicated full. he had also not refueled at both stops.
49137,"After taking off at low speed and in a crosswind, the aircraft pivoted to the left. As the pilot tried to control the aircraft, it lost altitude and then hit the water with its right wing."
49136,pilot attempted to avoid rocks that protruded from the surface while taking off from a small lake with his heavily loaded aircraft. immediately after taking off the pilot turned left to avoid more rocks. this maneuver put the aircraft into a crosswind. the aircraft then sank and hit the surface of the shallow water. the rear of the right float was torn by the rocks. the pilot kept the engine revs up and the aircraft slid over several rocks and ended up on the shore where it struck trees.
49131,the aircraft was heard touching down and taking off from a small lake. it is believed that after the go-around and turning to the right the pilot lost control of his aircraft. the aircraft crashed about 900 ft from the lake shore and in a steep nose-down attitude. the aircraft was destroyed by the ensuing fire. on impact all indications were that the engine was providing power. the accident claimed four lives the pilot and his three passengers.
49121,pilot was towing an advertising banner when the engine suddenly lost power. the pilot released the banner and made a forced landing on a paved road. during the landing roll while the pilot was braking hard to avoid an oncoming vehicle the aircraft struck a guardrail. the loss of power was due to a bad contact or grounding of a magneto.
49113,"After takeoff from a body of water, witnesses saw the aircraft climbing at a gentle angle to about 150 feet. When the pilot initiated a slight left turn, the engine sputtered several times and then stopped completely. The aircraft stalled and crashed into the woods; both occupants were fatally injured. Laboratory inspection did not reveal the causes of the engine failure."
49112,having landed in a small clearing on the top of a mountain the pilot noticed that the aircraft was not level. he therefore took off again to initiate a left turn and land elsewhere. during the turn the tail rotor struck a tree which caused a loss of directional control. the pilot cut the throttle and tried to land. the helicopter's skids broke when they hit the ground during the turn and the aircraft lay on its side.
49111,"as he was preparing to land, the left wing hit an electrical cable and then a tree and the pilot lost control of his aircraft and crashed."
49110,to land at night at roberval the surface wind was transmitted to the pilot by the flight information station. he misunderstood the wind direction and landed in the wrong direction. the touchdown was made well after the runway threshold due to the lack of approach lighting. a very large quantity of water covering the runway the braking was weak and the plane cleared the runway to end up in a ditch.
49109,"The pilot attempted to take off from a 900-foot field with a large plywood sign at the end. Acceleration was slow due to long grass and a bumpy surface, and the pilot had to abort the takeoff. The aircraft struck the sign and crossed a road before coming to rest in a ditch."
49108,"About 20 minutes after departure for a second spraying flight, the secondary hydraulic circuit failed. Hydraulic pumps number 3 and 4 were immediately shut down. The flight engineer was able to attribute the cause of the problem to a rupture of the hydraulic line in the forward baggage compartment. The secondary circuit operates the landing gear, the brakes, the nose wheel steering control, the high-lift flaps and the spraying circuit pumps. Since it was impossible to continue spraying, the crew decided to jettison fuel and fly to their maintenance base. The load was not jettisoned because of the high cost of the insecticide in question. This was contrary to the CDN limit which states in part that ""no landing is permitted when there is spray in the tanks"". During the approach the landing gear was extended in the normal manner except that pumps number 3 and 4 were switched on after the crew had selected ""gear down"" and then switched off once the gear was down and locked. The hydraulic reservoir was refilled and the same method was to be used to extend the flaps. However, as the crew had selected ""flaps down"" and switched the pumps back on, the nose wheel became unstuck. The pumps were then switched off and the flap selector was set to the retracted position. During the go-around the hand pump selector was set to the ""emergency gear"" position and the nose wheel was locked in the extended position by means of the pressure obtained by applying the hand pump. the crew elected to execute a flaps-up landing due to the nose wheel problem and to use the emergency system to provide braking. all indications are that during the landing preparation the setting of the brake selector to the ""emergency"" position was the only ""vital action"" of the emergency checks that was taken. there was no indication that the hand pump selector was returned to the ""brake"" position or that the emergency outlet or brake pressure reservoir was checked. the approach was flown at a speed of 122 knots and the aircraft touched down approximately 800 feet beyond the runway threshold. after the nose wheel contacted the captain applied full reverse and maximum brakes. at the same time the pilot was attempting to maintain emergency brake pressure. The co-pilot stated that he did not feel any increase in pressure through the hand pump. At about halfway down the runway, there was no emergency brake pressure remaining. Realizing that the aircraft was going to overshoot the end of the runway, the captain ordered the engineer to cut all circuits. The flight engineer was able to cut the master switch but could do nothing else because the aircraft had begun to bounce on the rough terrain. The aircraft continued to roll until about 1,100 feet beyond the end of the runway, during which time the nose wheel and main landing gear collapsed and all four engines were torn from their engine mounts. The aircraft turned 120 degrees to the left before coming to a stop. During disassembly several days after the accident, sparks ignited the remaining fuel and the wreckage was completely destroyed."
49107,"was on approach to land on a lake when he apparently encountered a downdraft 25 feet above the water's surface. The aircraft struck the water violently; the right wing attachment broke and the fuselage tilted far enough to the right that the propeller ripped a large hole in the right float. Fortunately, the pilot was able to bring his seaplane into shallow water near the shore."
49103,The pilot stated that after a normal landing he was turning around to go back up the gravel runway. Suddenly a strong gust lifted the right wing and flipped the plane over. The weather forecast called for gusty winds and vortices for the area.
49102,"ferry flight between gagnon and mascouche included technical stops at st-honore and la tuque. arriving too early in st-honore to refuel, the pilot decided to head for jonquiere. but there he was unable to obtain fuel. he then set a course for la tuque. navigation was difficult because of the fog but he maintained his course until the limit of his eta. while making a reconnaissance circle he realized that he was 15 miles southeast of la tuque and that the fuel gauges indicated that the tanks were empty. he therefore decided to land on a country road and his engine ran out of fuel during the base leg. after the wheels touched the ground, the left wing struck a tree and the aircraft did a wooden horse."
49097,had taken off from st-john newfoundland for a scheduled six hour flight to ottawa with stops in moncton fredericton sherbrooke and montreal. although he did not have a night endorsement the pilot left late in the day. while flying over fredericton where weather conditions were good he realized he had very little fuel left but decided to go to sherbrooke anyway. over sherbrooke he was advised that the fuel pumps were closed so he decided to go to valcourt 25 miles northwest to refuel. he could not find the airport in the dark so he attempted a precautionary landing on the highway when the fuel reached a critical level. During the approach the plane hit electrical cables and overturned in a ditch.
49095,"taking off from a helicopter pad in the bush the pilot climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet to avoid trees. as he leveled off and handed over to gain speed the helicopter entered a right turn. the pilot corrected with his left foot but was unable to stop the turn. as he was close to the trees he pulled back on the collective pitch and tried to regain control by applying cyclic in the direction of the turn. he was unable to stop the turning movement and the aircraft plunged into the trees. It is likely that this accident was caused by what the Flight Safety Foundation called ""tail rotor failure"". The pilot took off into the wind on a heading of 090 and immediately climbed to 20 to 30 feet to avoid trees. The wind forecast for the area was from the southwest. It is therefore possible that it changed abruptly to a right three-quarters aft wind as the helicopter leveled off over the trees. Under these conditions, the aircraft would have weathervaned. If this startled the pilot, he may not have reacted until the yaw rate became too high. If he applied full left trim at this point, there is a good chance that his tail rotor would have become completely ineffective. The helicopter would have continued to turn itself because the main rotor was no longer compensated by the anti-torque of the tail rotor."
49092,"Realizing that his approach was too high to land on a stretch of bush road that served as a runway, the pilot decided to go around. The engine first accelerated and then suffered a momentary loss of power, forcing the pilot to make a forced landing. In a sideslip, he managed to land the plane but at too high a speed and too close to the end of the runway. As he did not think he could stop in time to avoid a pile of wood and trees at the end of the runway, he decided to deliberately perform a hobby horse. The left wing scraped the ground and the plane nosedived into the soft sand at the side of the runway, but it stopped before the obstacle."
49088,takeoff was made from a sheltered section of the river. when the aircraft was caught in a strong wind blowing in gusts above the trees it pitched up and banked to the left. the pilot regained control of his aircraft and decided to continue the left turn to return to land downwind. after a 180 degree turn he had to dive towards the river to avoid the trees. the aircraft had partially sunk when the occupants were rescued by a boat.
49081,"Due to strong gusts of wind during landing, the pilot inadvertently retracted the landing gear shortly after touchdown, believing it to be the flaps. The landing gear collapsed."
49080,"The pilot had circled several times at low altitude to inspect an orchard before beginning his spraying flight. As the aircraft was coming out of a 180-degree turn to begin the first pass, the pilot, attempting to reduce an excessive rate of descent, opened the throttle too quickly and the engine lost power. The pilot dumped his load and headed for an open field, but the aircraft struck trees during the approach."
49077,"The pilot left solo after completing a check flight with his instructor. On the first landing, the aircraft touched down hard and bounced; the pilot lost control and the aircraft skidded to the left before leaving the runway."
49067,"The pilot was trying to land on a mobile platform that was to be used to tow him into the hangar. In his attempt, he struck one of the platform's wheels with the right float, which was above floor level. He lost control of the aircraft, which crashed to the ground on its left side. The risks of an accident of this type were also increased because the platform's wheels were above the landing surface."
49064,"Having previously checked the snow conditions, the pilot landed on a surface compacted by the passage of snowmobiles. After driving for a distance of approximately 300 ft, the wheels pierced the crust of the snow and the aircraft capsized. Seven days before the accident, a friend of the pilot had checked the condition of the landing area; everything seemed fine to him. Unfortunately, this person had no aeronautical experience."
49062,25 miles from his destination the pilot reported that he was at 300 ft/aol and that he planned to land at the airport despite the weather conditions becoming unfavourable i.e.: ceiling 600 feet visibility 1/4 mile in snow and fog. at the destination the beaver flew low over the airport for 9 minutes to land. during this time the pilot reported that he could only see the vicinity of the airport intermittently. during this same period the pilot of a twin otter who was making an instrument approach transmitted his intention to abort the approach to avoid a mid-air collision. the beaver pilot responded that he would immediately make an approach to an unmarked runway. Forty-six seconds later the latter crashed 300 ft from the runway threshold while apparently trying to line up with the runway centreline.
49058,pilot reported that while cruising at 1500 feet his engine misfired and lost power. he turned on the carburetor heat without result; on the contrary the engine stopped. after two unsuccessful restarts the pilot made a forced landing in a snowy field. the water found in the fuel filter and the very low temperatures seem to indicate that the frozen fuel lines were the cause of the engine failure. the principle of this flying club is not to completely fill the tanks in cold weather which encourages condensation. this aircraft is not equipped with a gravity-fed fuel system and the pilot did not use the electric pressure relief pump which made any attempt to restart the engine in flight impossible.
49057,pilot reported that the engine stopped after a few misfires. during the forced landing the landing gear caught some electrical wires causing the plane to nose dive towards the ground where it flipped over in deep snow. the plane had been sitting in a hangar with the tanks three-quarters full. fuel had been added for the flight. it is therefore likely that condensation occurred and the fuel system froze.
49054,"that he was on final for a touch and go the student pilot decided to try a short landing to practice. he made a low altitude, power-on, flapless approach. after estimating his glide distance the pilot reduced the throttle. unfortunately he made an error in judgment during the flare and hit a snow bank 330 feet before the runway threshold."
49047,"During a left crosswind landing the aircraft bounced several times, skidded to the right and hit a hard snow bank."
48058,that he was in level flight the pilot heard a thud and his speed dropped by 20 knots. he correctly deduced that a hydraulic failure had occurred and that the main landing gear was down. given that the main landing gear is held in the retracted position by hydraulic pressure (electric pump and reservoir assembly). the emergency hand pump draws its hydraulic fluid from the same source and it was impossible to lower the landing gear. the pilot successfully performed a landing with the landing gear up. investigators found a leak in the hydraulic system that had not been repaired.
48055,that the plane was circling at low altitude over a house the engine misfired. the pilot applied the throttle but the engine did not respond and he had to make a forced landing on a narrow road. during the approach the throttle was left at maximum speed and the engine began to develop power at the touchdown. the throttle was immediately pulled back but during the taxi a wing hit a pole and the plane stopped in a ditch.
48053,"that he was taxiing on the ground before takeoff, the pilot, making a mistake at the crossing, veered to the right and hit a snow and ice bank which caused the front and left landing gear to collapse. Heavy snow obstructed the pilot's field of vision, as he was unfamiliar with the airport. Slots made in the snow banks along the taxiways in order to clear the runways led the pilot to make a short turn."
48046,"The pilot began a descent from an altitude of 6,000 ft. During the descent he applied carburetor heat and set the fuel selector to both tanks. As the aircraft approached 2,300 ft. the engine stopped completely. Attempts to restart it were unsuccessful. The pilot, realizing that he would not be able to reach the airport, chose a field to make a forced landing. The aircraft rolled some 30 feet after touching down, struck a mound of earth in a nose-down pitch and flipped over."
48043,the practical test for his instructor qualifications the pilot started his flare too late while demonstrating a fully engaged autorotational landing. the examiner took over the controls after the tail rotor struck the ground and the main rotor blades struck the tail boom.
48036,The pilot was flying in a low cloud ceiling in a mountainous area familiar to him when the plane hit the top of a hill. The accident occurred after the pilot climbed into the clouds to avoid rising terrain.
48019,"After taking off from a small lake, the seaplane apparently lost power after stalling. It crashed into trees. The two passengers and a witness on the ground reported hearing the engines idle and lose power just before the aircraft turned to the left."
48011,"was at 5000 ft vfr from st. john new brunswick to quebec. the weather deteriorated 50 mi from arrival and the pilot descended to a lower altitude shortly after the aircraft struck the side of a 3000 foot hill. at the time of impact the aircraft was in level flight with considerable engine power. the weather forecast called for broken clouds at 2000 ft with stratus formation in precipitation at low altitudes between 500 and 800 ft. the quebec terminal bulletin called for a ceiling of 700 ft with broken clouds overcast at 2000 ft and visibility of 4 miles with fog and light precipitation. witnesses reported that the tops of the hills were hidden in cloud and that light rain was falling. The aircraft's heading and altitude at the time of impact, as well as the weather conditions, indicate that the pilot was trying to maintain visual flight and that the restricted visibility prevented him from seeing the mountain because of the restricted visibility."
48009,The pilot lost control of his aircraft after landing when the landing gear went into a rut. The investigation was unable to confirm the condition of the runway.
48007,"The pilot and his passenger, who were having their first flight, headed to a nearby lake where they were waiting for friends. The pilot then made low passes. During the third pass, at the start of a left turn, the wingtip touched the water; the plane crashed and sank."
48006,pilot stated that he was attempting to take off from a field with grass about a foot high. acceleration was very slow and the plane refused to lift off. while trying to stop its momentum the pilot applied the rudder pedals to avoid a fence but hit a mound of earth and the landing gear collapsed.
48005,The pilot landed at too high a speed and went off the end of the runway. The investigation showed that the brakes were in poor working order.
48003,"Due to a crosswind, the pilot decided to modify his spreading pattern and positioned himself headwind facing the rising sun. At the start of the fourth pass, dazzled by the sun and hampered by a barn, he hit a high-voltage line. The pilot had neglected to inspect the area properly and had only limited experience in spreading."
48002,lost as dusk approached the student pilot attempted an emergency landing on an isolated stretch of road. on approach the aircraft stalled at about 20 feet and landed hard. the shock absorbers went right through the wings the landing gear collapsed and the aircraft slid onto the fuselage damaging the airframe wings and propeller.
47998,"The pilot stated that during an approach he had placed the anti-icing switch in the \""off\"" position. At this time the engine stopped. The hard landing that followed caused significant damage. A fuel sample was examined; the results were satisfactory. The engine was checked on the test bench; as it was operating normally it was put back into service. One of the passengers who said he had logged several hours on board this type of aircraft stated that he had seen the pilot operate the fuel valve. At the time of the interview he correctly identified this valve and recalled that it was painted red, meaning \""danger\"". This symbol is located just above the valve. The witness also stated that he had seen a red warning light come on at the same time and that he had heard the audible warning indicating an engine failure. It appears that the pilot operated the fuel valve instead of the anti-icing switch, which caused the engine failure. As the helicopter was at too low an altitude when the failure occurred, the pilot had to perform an autorotation, unable to restart the turbine."
47991,pilot was demonstrating the handling of his aircraft to another pilot. downwind and at low altitude he lost sight of the runway while switching to base leg he raised the nose of the aircraft in order to regain sight of the runway. he made the last turn too tight and the aircraft went into a spin. the pilot had practically controlled the spin when the aircraft crashed into the trees.
47980,"pilot was practicing aerodrome circuits and landings. during his first landing he had difficulty maintaining directional control of his aircraft, which he lost completely during the second landing. the aircraft left the runway and hit a telephone cable signal beacon. the investigation revealed that at this school there was a total lack of standardization in technical instruction."
47978,The plane's planned route The weather forecast indicated: heavy rain with thunderstorms and low ceilings. The pilot took off anyway and the plane crashed shortly after on a wooded hill.
47968,engine failure the pilot went into a gliding position and turned left toward a suitable camp. at 100 to 200 feet above ground level the aircraft stalled. the pilot overcontrolled the stall recovery and the aircraft made a 90 degree turn away from the intended landing area and landed very hard. the aircraft stopped about 240 feet from the point of impact.
47967,"Shortly after takeoff the engine power dropped and the pilot decided to land straight ahead. The landing was hard and the landing gear dug into the sand, nearly causing the aircraft to capsize. The pilot pulled back on the cyclic and the main rotor blades severed the tail boom. The aircraft was overloaded by over 250 pounds and the temperature was 32 degrees C."
47952,began to pull to one side on touchdown and the pilot used only the rudder to correct. This measure proved insufficient and the aircraft left the runway and hit a snow bank. Neither the opposite brake nor the asymmetric torque of the engines were used to correct the deviation.
47950,Pilot lost directional control while landing in a crosswind on an ice-covered runway. The aircraft veered off the runway and struck a snowbank.
47947,During a local flight the engine began to run erratically and the rpm dropped. The pilot turned on the carburetor heat and the rpm became more regular. After a short while the oil pressure dropped to zero and the pilot decided to make a precautionary landing. After landing on a narrow icy road the aircraft hit a snow bank and turned over. The cause of the drop in oil pressure has not been determined.
47946,"solo was practicing landing, maneuvering and takeoff from a tight snowy field. while performing 360 degree turns while hovering the engine began to misfire. after this takeoff at 400 feet agl the rotor and engine speeds dropped. the pilot turned on the carburetor heat which had remained in the cold position throughout the exercise. the engine speed dropped further and the needles separated. since the engine speed did not increase by giving throttle the pilot reduced the collective pitch in preparation for an autorotation landing. the helicopter landed abruptly with the engine still at idle speed. before this flight it seems the engine had misfired. the inspection indicated that the throttle linkage was worn and loose."
47942,dusk the pilot attempted to take off from a snow-covered runway. during the takeoff roll the contours and edges of the runway merged with the surrounding terrain and the pilot experienced a whiteout. he aborted the takeoff too late and the left wheel entered the deep snow on the side of the runway. the aircraft swerved and overturned after leaving the runway.
47941,During a patrol flight the aircraft entered an updraft exceeding the aircraft's climb limits. The pilot therefore allowed the speed to drop to such an extent that the aircraft stalled and crashed into the trees.
47938,"mont joli the aircraft was to go to sept-iles via quebec. after takeoff the co-pilot performed the landing gear retraction manoeuvre and the cockpit immediately filled with smoke. given the absence of a landing gear retract indication and fearing that the landing gear retraction motor was the cause the captain pulled the circuit breaker. smoke immediately began to emerge. several attempts were made to extend the landing gear using the emergency device but in vain. the landing gear extension motor appeared to have failed and the landing gear was only three-quarters extended and stuck in place. the pilot therefore flew over sept-iles to burn fuel before landing on runway 32. the landing roll began with the landing gear partially extended but since the nose gear had collapsed on impact the nose of the aircraft began to touch the runway as soon as the aircraft slowed down. The latter came to rest on its main landing gear and belly. The investigation revealed that the landing gear extension motor had overheated and had jammed during landing gear extension. According to the manufacturer, this motor should be changed every 5,000 landings, but this one had already done 7,110. The internal door of the left main landing gear was loose and was rubbing against the inner tire, creating an additional handicap during landing gear retraction."
46963,"Following an engine failure on the last turn, the plane was unable to reach the runway and landed on a snowy field, where its nose gear broke and it overturned."
46953,a takeoff in gusty winds a wing tip touched the wing; the aircraft came to rest on its back.
46940,would not stand on the step during the take-off attempt and the pilot brought it back to shore where 2/3 of the cargo was unloaded. On the second attempt the aircraft took off but stalled and went into a spin on the surface of the water as the pilot tried to get over the trees bordering the small lake.
46936,"that the 15 mph current would slow the aircraft enough to allow it to land on the narrow water the co-pilot attempted to land with a 10 mph tailwind the aircraft had just touched the water when the captain, judging the remaining distance too short, took control to go around the water he turned right to avoid the shore during the water run once airborne the wing and left float struck the rocks but the aircraft was able to continue its flight."
46933,"As he was putting full throttle to take off again after landing, the pilot lost control of his aircraft, which left the narrow runway and ended up prematurely in the air at a very steep angle of attack. Realizing that he would not be able to pass over the obstacles in front of him, the pilot reduced the throttle and landed on marshy ground. The aircraft flipped over and caught fire."
46932,"The pilot stated that the cylinder head temperature had reached its maximum after takeoff and that the left engine was losing power. He then feathered the right engine propeller and landed straight ahead. The right engine had already experienced very high cylinder head temperatures and had been replaced. The friction wheel on the throttle sector had not been properly tightened; this would explain the loss of power on the left engine. The pilot, who was overly preoccupied with the operation of the right engine, probably feathered it by mistake. In addition, the emergency procedures followed by the pilot were inappropriate."
46931,on a return flight from lac maclure to lac saint-augustin the pilot contacted the quebec control tower while approaching orleans to ask about the weather conditions for lac saint-augustin. he was told that visibility was almost zero; the pilot therefore decided to land on the saint-lawrence river downstream from île d'orleans. the aircraft landed on the second attempt but capsized in the very rough waters. the four people on board managed to escape from the cabin and held on to the floats. later that night a large boat struck the wreck. the four survivors had managed to get away before the collision and the pilot managed to save the two passengers but was unable to help the third passenger. the three survivors were rescued early the next morning by the canadian coast guard.
46929,During the initial climb the pilot entered the flaps. He inadvertently stalled his aircraft while trying to maintain altitude and crashed into the trees.
46927,The pilot landed as soon as he noticed an internal fuel leak to determine the cause. He then decided that it would be necessary to return to an area more suitable for stopping the engine. He hovered his aircraft 3 feet above the ground when a gust of wind caused it to drift to the right. The right float struck a large rock which caused the helicopter to roll onto its side.
46923,"having made his intentions known by radio, the pilot made a landing at an uncontrolled airport. when his aircraft was halfway down the runway, the two occupants noticed another aircraft about to land in the opposite direction. the pilot braked and swerved to the right to avoid the aircraft coming towards him. this turn turned into a rotary movement which caused the left landing gear to retract. the pilot of the other aircraft had not made his intentions known by radio and has not yet been identified."
46919,"turning back due to bad weather, the plane hit the side of a mountain."
46905,"landed on a 12 by 9 foot log platform. When the pilot lowered the collective pitch the left skid slid off the platform, broke and the main rotor struck the ground."
46904,The pilot stalled the aircraft during the landing attempt and overturned. At the time of the accident the anemometer was not working.
46891,"a normal takeoff and climb the torque value increased to 110 percent. the pilot therefore removed the collective which had no effect on the torque. he then tried to turn around but a loud noise was heard in the engine compartment and the engine stopped. the investigation revealed that the oil jet for bearings 6 and 7 was blocked and that these, as well as the movable labyrinth seal pt, had dried out and disintegrated. 120 hours before the accident the carbon had been removed from the labyrinth seal and the recovery circuit and the oil type had been changed. it is possible that the oil change dislodged carbon particles and that these particles passed into the oil filter and blocked the oil jet for bearings 6 and 7."
46888,the landing run after a normal touch down the left main landing gear broke. the investigation revealed that many parts of the landing gear were excessively worn although the periodic inspections recommended by the manufacturer had all been carried out.
46887,"During a landing on shimmering water, the right float sank and the aircraft overturned."
46884,pilot was unable to lower his landing gear due to a complete electrical circuit failure. he lowered the gear by hand and landed the aircraft. on touchdown the gear collapsed and the aircraft landed on its belly on the runway. the emergency landing gear extension handle rotated 180 degrees around the screw jack and apparently prevented the landing gear from locking down. the electrical circuit failure was caused by an alternator problem (laboratory report lp 246/77).
46883,"had hovered after a sling load was dropped to allow two crew members to jump. The pilot initiated a right turn on the rudder pedals and the helicopter then yawed left and banked to the right. The pilot reported a loss of control. All indications were that a cable had struck the vertical stabilizer, but there was no evidence to justify the loss of control or determine when the strike occurred."
46879,pilot was landing in a strong crosswind gusting from the left. touchdown was normal but the airspeed suddenly dropped and the tail dropped. a strong gust of wind lifted the aircraft again causing it to drift to the right towards the trees bordering the runway. to avoid the trees the pilot opened the throttle and banked the aircraft to the right to take off again. the right wing touched the ground and the left wing touched the trees. the aircraft cartwheeled and came to rest on its right side.
46873,"struck a tree and then crashed to the ground at high speed with the engine running about 180 feet away. It slid another 25 feet before coming to a stop. It is presumed that the pilot was skimming the ground, but the cause of the crash could not be determined for sure."
46871,"While taxiing, the right wheel came into contact with a soft surface which caused the aircraft to deviate to the right. The pilot was unable to regain directional control and the right landing gear collapsed when it struck an icy snowdrift on the side of the narrow runway."
46863,"landed at st-hubert (quebec) at 19:07 EST after completing a 2 h 58 min vfr flight from wilkes-barre (pa.). the pilot then completed customs formalities and communicated his flight plan to the tower, indicating his intention to continue for 15 minutes to the cedres airport about 2 miles away and specifying that there was enough fuel on board for 3 hours of flight. he had refueled at wilkes-barre and did not refuel at st-hubert. night had now fallen and he asked the controller if the cedres runway lighting was on. the answer was inconclusive but he nevertheless decided to continue and at 19:45 he took off. at 1500 feet he levelled off and was then guided by radar by dorval terminal control. At 20:07 he was informed that Cedres Airport was at 11:00 and 1 mile. The pilot was unable to see the runway plunged into darkness. He therefore lined up with a lit service station itself on the axis of runway 25 and had just started the approach when the engine stopped. Forced to land straight ahead, he turned on the landing lights and touched down on flat ground 1/2 mile before the runway threshold. The aircraft was equipped with an automatic landing gear extension device but the excessive approach speed allowed only a partial extension; on contact with the ground, the wheels were pushed back into their housings. The pilot thought he had 6 hours of autonomy; however, the engine ran out of fuel after 3 h 28 of total flight time."
46861,engine stopped due to lack of fuel. during forced landing on a highway the aircraft capsized after hitting a snow bank. the instructor had miscalculated the fuel consumption and had not checked the fuel tanks with his own eyes before takeoff.
46855,the go-around during a forced landing training the engine did not respond. the pilot had not revved the engine during the descent and the engine had cooled down too much. the revving had been too rapid and the descent had begun below the minima recommended by the aeroclub.
46851,pilot lost directional control during a landing in whiteout conditions. he was unaware of the proper technique for landing on powder snow.
45877,landed halfway down the runway. Braking was poor due to the icy surface and the aircraft went off the end of the runway and came to rest in a snow bank.
45876,"was on a VFR flight from Saint-Hubert to Dolbeau. The weather conditions along the route were barely sufficient for a visual flight. For unknown reasons, the pilot made an unplanned stop at La Tuque to refuel. Shortly afterward, the pilot established radio contact with Roberval, announcing that he was lost and requesting assistance. Another aircraft tuned to the same frequency came to the aid of the pilot in distress, providing him with a heading toward Roberval. The aircraft arrived over Roberval and headed east over the lake to prepare to land. Shortly afterward, it crashed. The ceiling and visibility over the lake were factors leading to the accident."
45875,"Takeoff was attempted downwind on a temporarily icy strip. Due to the wet snow surface, acceleration was very slow and the pilot gave up on taking off. He initiated a turn to avoid a marsh. The turn was abrupt and a landing gear leg gave way."
45873,"full of passengers was on final approach. The pilot had feathered the left propeller because the engine had stopped due to lack of fuel. The landing gear hydraulic pump was mounted on the left engine and had to be operated by hand. Losing speed and altitude, the pilot made a single-engine emergency approach while operating the pump by hand to extend the gear to the flare. The approach and landing were successful, but the nose gear failed during taxiing. Investigation revealed that a factor in the engine failure was a fuel selector control cable that broke at the ball joint, causing the fuel selection to fail."
45872,touchdown on an ice-covered runway the pilot lost all visibility due to snow gusts. the aircraft slid to the side of the runway and the nose gear gave way in the deep snow on the shoulder of the runway.
45865,engine failed during a recreational flight. forced landing was not carried out properly. investigation revealed that the engine failure was caused by a frozen fuel line that had been improperly purged.
45855,During an attempt to land in strong winds the helicopter made a 90 degree turn to land into the wind. The tail rotor struck two small wires the pilot lost directional control and the helicopter turned 270 degrees before falling onto the tracks of a railway line and sliding down the embankment.
45849,"The pilot made a number of tight turns at approximately 500 feet agl while attempting to spot moose tracks in the snow. As soon as the aircraft leveled off, the engine suddenly lost power. The pilot then put the aircraft into a glide and attempted to correct its trajectory with a rich mixture, full throttle, and an auxiliary fuel pump running, but was unsuccessful. The aircraft then stalled and came to rest in the trees."
45846,a long period of storage the aircraft was subjected to a test flight by the owner pilot who was not in good physical condition. shortly after takeoff the aircraft crashed into the ground in a nose-down attitude. witnesses reported that the aircraft stalled at low altitude following a steep turn. the reasons for the steep turn and stall have not been determined.
45825,"During a takeoff from a grass strip the pilot decided to abort the takeoff because of obstacles and then realized he would not be able to stop in time. He then applied full throttle and rose into the air. The aircraft struck and fatally injured a spectator, struck two cars and landed in a river. The pilot had only three hours of flying experience on the type involved, including twenty-five minutes of type check."
45819,"Following a landing in 40 to 60 mph winds, the pilot carefully maintained a path into the wind and allowed the aircraft to drift backwards for 45 minutes toward a sheltered bay. In order to maneuver into the bay and near the dock, the aircraft had to be turned. While the aircraft was maneuvering in a steep swell, a gust of wind from behind caused it to capsize."
45815,"During a spraying maneuver while the pilot was busy closing a valve, the helicopter hit some wires at the end of the field."
45813,approaching to land on a shimmering body of water the pilot misjudged his altitude. the aircraft hit the body of water in a nose-down attitude and flipped over.
45811,"ran out of fuel. Following a forced approach to a quarter-mile-long artificial lake, the aircraft capsized as it entered the shore."
45810,pilot performed low altitude maneuvers to obtain his spraying qualification. while passing under a high voltage line following a low altitude pass the left spray boom struck a road sign. the pilot performed a steep climb to approximately 200 feet then initiated a tight right turn. the aircraft stalled and nose-dived toward the ground.
45807,was afloat with the engine running while a technician collected water samples. The aircraft drifted backwards due to a strong current and the tail rotor struck a floating beacon.
45800,landed on a poorly constructed platform. One of the support beams was loose and the helicopter slid backwards and came to rest on the tail boom.
45790,During the landing roll the landing gear collapsed when the aircraft passed over a bump on the runway. The investigation revealed that the circuit breaker for the landing gear had tripped and that the gear had not locked before the landing gear.
45789,approaching to land on a flat body of water the pilot misjudged his altitude. the aircraft hit the water in a nose-down attitude and capsized.
45785,takeoff the pilot pulled the aircraft off at low speed but it bounced once before flying away. seeing that the climb speed was insufficient the pilot cut the throttle and lowered the nose of the aircraft. the latter hit the water in a pronounced nose-down attitude near the shore.
45784,"The pilot had difficulty extending the right landing gear. After several attempts, he decided to land with the wheels retracted. The right landing gear extension mechanism had not worked."
45783,was on a test flight following maintenance of the landing system. after completing a circuit and operating the landing gear several times the pilot made a full stop landing on the runway with the landing gear down. after another takeoff he attempted to land on water but after touchdown the aircraft veered left and overturned. the investigation revealed that the left rear landing gear was not retracted for an unknown reason. it is possible that the landing gear did not retract during the circuit.
45778,at the end of an ADF approach downwind in tangent weather conditions the pilot sees his speed start to drop even after he had retracted the gear and flaps and displays the climb power. as the speed is still dropping he displays the maximum power continuous but without effect. the aircraft crashed 1/4 mile before the runway in all retract configuration and the engines at full power.
45776,"did not return from a budworm survey flight. It was later discovered that it had crashed into a frozen lake. The exact time of the accident could not be determined, but it is likely to have occurred between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. local time. At the time, the wind was blowing strongly and gustily, and was accompanied by snow showers. It is possible that the turbulence caused the pilot to lose control of his aircraft or that he hit the ice in the middle of a ""whiteout"". There is no evidence of physical incapacity of the pilot or of mechanical failure. The distress radio beacon did not work because the automatic trigger switch was mounted upside down. See laboratory reports 81/76 82/76 109/76 111/76 6/77 and 7/77."
45770,"The takeoff was with a three-quarter tailwind. As soon as it was in the air, the aircraft drifted towards the windsock located at the edge of the runway and came to a stop on its back."
45769,landed on a sloping snow surface. Once the occupant of the left seat exited the helicopter rolled over to the right.
45765,"Landing on runway 07 in a three-quarter tailwind blowing with gusts, the pilot lost directional control and the aircraft veered to the right of the runway."
45758,a dual check flight the student is authorized to make circuits of the runway alone on board. on landing the aircraft pulls to the right and enters the snow bank which runs alongside the runway. the rapid heating and cooling of the brakes had caused ice to form in the right brake.
45757,a normal takeoff the pilot hears a noise at the front of the plane. he lands and the noise stops. putting the throttle back on he feels resistance and cuts the throttle. at this moment the front wheel goes away. after greasing the front wheel bearings we forgot to put a split pin in the lock nut.
45746,approach on a snow-covered runway the aircraft struck a snow bank near the threshold. the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft slid to finally stop on the pylon. the runway threshold was not marked and it was difficult to distinguish it from the air because of the layer of snow.
45745,"The pilot had difficulty locating the destination airport and made a precautionary landing on a snow-covered road because he was low on fuel. At the end of the run, the aircraft slid to the left and the wing struck trees."
45743,"During a training flight, a simulated forced approach was carried out. When the engine was put into operation at 900 feet/ground, it began to vibrate strongly. The instructor carried out a forced landing in a snowy field; the aircraft made a pylon. One of the valves had remained stuck in the open position."
45738,that he was in translation the pilot found himself in a whiteout. he lost control of the aircraft when he tried to land. the right skid touched the ground and the aircraft overturned.
45734,"arrived over its destination low on fuel. the pilot, distracted by the little fuel remaining, made two 360-degree turns to lose altitude. the engine stopped on approach and the aircraft landed short of the runway."
