While climbing out of MMMX through FL290 the crew heard a thud noise coming from the main cargo compartment. The crew also felt a pressure bump in their ears. Both crew immediately looked to the pressure controller and noticed that the cabin rate of climb was well exceeding 1000 feet per minute. Within seconds the cabin pressure altitude climbed in excess of 10000 feet causing the Cabin Altitude light to illuminate and horn to sound. The captain already in the Pilot Flying Position announced to the crew to don their oxygen masks and to establish communications. As the cabin was still climbing at a significant rate the crew declared a PAN PAN with ATC and requested an immediate descent. Initial descent clearance was given to FL200. An emergency descent was initiated. The aircraft was flying over mountainous terrain at night so considerations were made for this. The captain requested the QRH for Cabin Altitude. The crew discussed options and it was decided to return to MMMX. The captain utilized the PA to advise the ACMs to don their oxygen masks and advised them of the problem. ATC cleared the crew to PAZ and then to ENAGA for the ENAGA2B arrival for Runway 23L. This is the longest runway at MMMX. Further descent was given when safe and in accordance with the arrival procedure. The crew carried out the QRH procedures for Cabin Altitude and then Cabin Automatic Inoperative. These checklists did not prove able to establish any control of the aircraft pressurization although the first officer was able to manually move the outflow valve but to no effect. Oxygen masks were removed when cabin altitude was at a safe altitude. Arrival ATC cleared the aircraft for an approach and to switch to tower. The first officer would advise each subsequent controller that they had declared a PAN. The Tower controller advised the crew to maintain 160kias until MX402 the Final Approach Fix. They were number two to the runway for landing. Normal aircraft configuration was done and the QRH Landing Checklist was completed. The tower advised to continue as the previous aircraft was still on the runway. For some reason the previous aircraft decided to clear at the end of a 13000 runway. When the crew reached decision altitude no clearance had been given. The first officer could not get a word in edgewise to obtain the clearance. The captain disconnected the autopilot with the hopes of a late clearance but also ready for a go- around. At approximately 100 feet the Captain initiated the missed approach procedure. Clearance to land was given while the aircraft was well established in the initial go around procedure. The crew carried out the published missed approach; ATC provided vectors for a subsequent approach. The missed approach altitude was 12000 feet which triggered the Cabin Altitude Warnings again.

During the oceanic entry cruising at FL340 in the vicinity of waypoint ETIKI the flight crew received intermittent amber “A” messages on both PFDs associated with AP TRIM IS RWD and AP TRIM IS LWD EICAS messages. Transfer of the autopilot from one side to the other did not resolve the problem and as the flight crew decided to fly the aircraft manually there was a rapid and significant roll of less than 20° to the right when the autopilot was disconnected. Extreme force was required to roll the aircraft back to the left while turning to the right was normal. The flight crew executed the emergency checklist and requested a direct routing to Shannon Intl Ireland (EINN). No emergency was declared and aileron control improved as the aircraft descended. The aircraft subsequently landed on Runway 06 with Flaps 20 and ARFF standing by.During the post flight inspection the operator’s maintenance noted that there was a significant amount of water dripping from the underside of the fuselage aft of the wheel well in proximity of the lower beacon. The operator is suspecting that a water leak caused a freezing of the aileron trim mechanism.On November 23 2017 the aircraft manufacturer reported the following:Maintenance troubleshooting noted extensive contamination (dirt grit etc.) in the pulleys cables artificial feel units (quadrants) and autopilot servo all located in the main wheel well area. This area is exposed to the outside environment and can become contaminated over time. It is believed that the contamination was the cause of the control difficulties experienced by the crew in this case. During flight moisture in the contamination can freeze and with enough contamination present cause a jam in the bearings in the quadrants impeding free movement of the ailerons requiring higher force input from the crew to operate them.

While approximately 10 nm south-east of LFLY Lyon airport the helicopter started to yaw to the left; the yaw could not be corrected by the pilot. The copilot declared an emergency and radar guidance was given to Lyon airport. Passengers were briefed the checklist completed for the landing which was uneventful. After landing the pilot managed to manoeuvre to taxiway November. On first inspection no faults were found. There was no other damage to the helicopter and no one was injured. Maintenance arrived from Canada the next day. Upon inspection it was discovered that the tail rotor control tube had failed. Bell helicopter was advised and a Service Difficulty Report filed with TC. The helicopter is waiting for replacement parts and repair. The failed tube will be examined to determine the nature of the failure. UPDATE 6 SEPTEMBER 2013:  Following examination of the failed control tube (P/N 430-001-007-101) it was found that the bonded clevis failed due to fatigue caused by oscillation of the control tube assembly. Another control tube failure occurrence was reported on 13 June 2013; a routine annual maintenance inspection found chaffing on the control tube. During removal of the control tube the clevis failed at the same location as the clevis in this occurrence. Consequently Bell Helicopters produced an Alert Service Bulletin (ASB 430-13-51 PSL7000000051 Tail Rotor Control Tube Assembly Modification) issued 3 September 2013. The Alert Service Bulletin introduces a one-time inspection of the control tube assembly to verify if chaffing damage exists on the tube. In addition procedure is provided to apply some lead tape to the control tube. This modification will reduce the amplitude of radial vibration and prevent contact of the tube with adjoining parts and structure. Previously technical Bulletin 430-04-35 was issued to replace the P/N 430-001-007-101 with a new -105 control tube assembly. As soon as sufficient parts become available a revision to this bulletin will require mandatory removal from service of the -101 control tubes.    ,No,Unknown,C-FWLS,HELICOPTER,BELL HELICOPTER,GORDCO ADMINISTRATION INC.,PRIVATE,2251-5700 KG    (4961-12565 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,LIGHT,2000,2,NONE,BUSINESS,

The flight crew was monitoring the fuel consumption for the number 2 engine and calculated that it was consuming 500 kg/hr more fuel than the number one engine. This was below the maximum limits of 500 kg/0.5hr consumption which the crew must consider as a fuel leak and has to shut down the engine. Further calculations by the crew determined that there was sufficient fuel on board to continue the flight to destination. At the top of descent the fuel consumption had increased to a level that the engine was not capable of normal operation and the flight crew shut down the engine (CF6-80C2B6F) and declared an emergency. The aircraft landed uneventfully with ARFF standing by. Maintenance determined that the high fuel consumption was a result of a fuel leak at the Fuel/Oil Heat Exchanger. The inlet fuel flange attachment bolts were found not to be correctly torqued resulting in the fuel leak. Further investigation also determined that there had been maintenance performed in this area and not properly completed. The fuel inlet flange seals were replaced and the bolts were torqued to the recommended values and the aircraft was returned to service.

The helicopter was substantially damaged and the lone pilot received only minor injuries.  The Portugese CAA Department of Accident Investigation is investigating.  The Bell 205 was one of three helicopters engaged in water-bucketting operations to fight a nearby forest fire and the pilot had used the same irrigation dam about 20 times that day before the accident.  On the last approach the pilot reported that he saw a \Master Caution\"" warning come on during the flare; he had insufficient time however to evaluate the warning.  He tried to push the cyclic forward but found it very heavy to move and he had to apply a considerable effort to get the nose down.  At the same time he applied collective to stop the rate of descent but it was apparently ineffective as the helicopter continued to descend and landed hard.The pilot reported that the helicopter was light with about 600 pounds of fuel onboard at the time and that the approach was into a light headwind.More information to follow.""",No,Unknown,C-GFHC,HELICOPTER,BELL HELICOPTER,FRONTIER HELICOPTERS,COMMERCIAL,2251-5700 KG    (4961-12565 LBS),SKID,LIGHT,0,1,SUBSTANTIAL,FIRE FIGHTING / FIRE MANAGEMENT,

About 350 miles northwest of Goose Bay Newfoundland an impending bypass of the right engine (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4) oil filter was indicated by the illumination of a warning light in the cockpit. After the filter bypass light illuminated the captain reduced power on the affected engine until the light went out. Approximately 10 minutes later the filter bypass light came on again and the captain reduced the power to idle thrust where the light went out. The light re-illuminated approximately 20 minutes later at which time the captain followed the appropriate procedure and shut down the engine. The aircraft diverted to and landed at Goose Bay Airport Newfoundland where an inspection of the oil filter was carried out. A substantial amount of silver flakes was found in the filter; the operator decided to remove the engine and ship it to their maintenance facility for  teardown. The main gearbox was removed from the engine and disassembled. Examination revealed that approximately 40 per cent of the silver plating on the main oil pump drive gearshaft gear teeth had peeled off. The metal found in the oil filter was analysed and it was determined to be silver. However the quantity of silver plating missing from the gear teeth and found in the oil filter was not enough to clog the filter and cause a bypass condition. Further examination of the oil filter revealed a greyish-black substance engrained in the filter paper. This paper is normally a light brown or tan colour. The contaminated oil filter from this engine and an oil filter from another engine were sent for comparative analysis. The analysis revealed that the contaminated oil filter had a significantly higher-than-normal iron content and that silica was also present. Based on the laboratory analysis and the fact that no cause was found for the greyish-black substance in the oil  filter or the extremely dirty oil found in the engine the TWA Engine Review Committee decided to disassemble the entire engine. Inspection of all the main-line bearings and associated carbon seals as well as the angle gearbox did not reveal any discrepancies or abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings: 1. The right engine impending bypass oil filter warning light illuminated in flight. 2. The captain shut down the engine and landed at the nearest alternate airport. 3. Approximately 40 per cent of the silver plating on the main oil pump gearshaft gear teeth had peeled off. 4. The oil filter was contaminated with a greyish-black substance a higher-than-normal iron content and traces of silica. Causes: The oil filter was contaminated with a greyish-black substance which caused an impending bypass condition. The source of the contaminant was not determined. L'avion effectuait un vol transatlantique entre Londres en Angleterre et St. Louis aux etats-Unis. a environ 350 milles au nord-ouest de Goose Bay (Terre-Neuve) un voyant d'alarme s'est allume dans le poste de pilotage pour signaler une derivation imminente au filtre a huile du reacteur droit (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4). Quand le voyant de derivation du filtre s'est allume le commandant de bord a reduit la poussee sur le reacteur en cause jusqu'a ce que le voyant s'eteigne. Environ 10 minutes plus tard le voyant s'est allume de nouveau et le commandant a reduit la poussee au ralenti et le voyant s'est eteint. Le voyant s'est allume de nouveau environ 20 minutes plus tard. Le commandant a alors applique la procedure appropriee et a arrete le reacteur. L'avion a ete deroute sur l'aeroport de Goose Bay a Terre-Neuve ou il a atterri et une inspection du filtre a huile a ete effectuee. Une quantite importante de paillettes argentees a ete trouvee dans le filtre.  L'exploitant a decide de deposer le reacteur et de l'envoyer a son atelier d'entretien pour le demontage. Le relais d'accessoires principal a ete enleve du reacteur et demonte. L'examen a revele qu'environ 40 pour cent du placage en argent des dents du pignon de l'arbre de prise de mouvement de la pompe a huile principale s'etait ecaille. Le metal trouve dans le filtre a huile a ete analyse et il a ete determine qu'il s'agissait d'argent. Cependant la quantite de placage en argent qui manquait aux dents de l'engrenage et trouvee dans le filtre a huile n'etait pas suffisante pour obstruer le filtre et causer une derivation. Un examen plus approfondi du filtre a huile a revele la presence d'une substance grisatre et noire qui encrassait le papier filtrant. Ce papier est normalement d'un brun pale ou ocre. Le filtre a huile pollue de ce reacteur ainsi que le filtre a huile d'un autre reacteur ont ete envoyes afin qu'une analyse comparative soit effectuee.

ROC / LOS,13:34:00,INCIDENT,,7/8/1987 12:00:00 AM,UNKNOWN,ATLANTIC,Delta Flight 37 a Lockheed L-1011 departed London's Gatwick Airport on 08 July 1987 at 1334 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)* on a scheduled international flight to Cincinnati Ohio. Continental Flight 25 a Boeing 747-200 departed Gatwick Airport five minutes later at 1339 UTC on a scheduled international flight to Newark New Jersey. As both aircraft approached the oceanic boundary Shanwick Oceanic Control Centre assigned parallel routes separated by 60 nautical miles for the flight across the North Atlantic. Both aircraft were assigned a pressure altitude of 31000 feet (flight level 310)**. At 30 degrees west longitude Delta 37 began deviating to the south of its assigned track and closed laterally with Continental 25 (see Figure 1.1.). Delta 37's deviation continued until the aircraft crossed the assigned track of Continental 25. As Delta 37 crossed the track of Continental 25 the front half of Delta 37 passed beneath the rear fuselage of Continental 25  with less than 100 feet of vertical separation. Neither crew saw the other aircraft in time to take evasive action. The near collision occurred during the hours of daylight at 1625 UTC over the North Atlantic at lat 52o45'N long 33o12'W***. 3.1 Findings 1. The near collision resulted from an INS data input error by the Delta Flight 37 crew. 2. Delta Flight 37's crew did not follow established INS cross-checks. 3. Delta Flight 37 while at flight level 310 deviated 80 nautical miles south of its assigned track after passing 30 west. 4. Delta Flight 37 crossed the track of Continental Flight 25 which was also at flight level 310. 5. Neither aircraft crew saw the other aircraft in time to take evasive action and the angle of closure made a visual sighting unlikely. 6. The forward fuselage of Delta Flight 37 passed beneath the rear fuselage of Continental Flight 25 with less than 100 feet of vertical separation. 7. Continental Flight 25 was maintaining its assigned  track. 8. Delta 37's flight crew had limited experience in North Atlantic flying with no crew member having more than six return trips. 9. Although cross-check procedures were contained in explicit detail in the manuals used by the crew they were set out in such terms and format that a mandatory requirement to cross-check at each and every waypoint may not have been clearly conveyed to aircrew. 10. The ATC clearances received and acknowledged by both aircraft were correct and if followed would not have resulted in a loss of separation. 11. The occurrence was not reported to ATC in a timely manner by the involved flight crews in accordance with ICAO requirements. 12. Continental Flight 25 reported the occurrence to company dispatch as it approached New York. 13. The estimate for Delta Flight 37 at 40 west showing a difference of 16 minutes was not challenged by ATC nor was it required to be in the circumstances of this incident. 14. There is no direct  pilot/controller communication on transatlantic flights. 15. HF communications on transatlantic flights may be subject to significant time delays. 16. About 1.5 hours after the first occurrence the crew of Delta Flight 37 misinterpreted an ATC clearance and the aircraft was involved in a technical loss of separation with another aircraft. 17. The Delta 37 flight crew was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. 18. The Delta 37 aircraft was certified equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. 19. No evidence was found that would indicate the Delta 37 INS was malfunctioning prior to or during the flight. 3.2 Causes A navigation error resulting from an INS data input error led to the near collision. The error was not detected because the crew who were relatively inexperienced with Atlantic crossings did not perform adequate cross-checks of the INS. The company did not provide clear  direction on the INS procedures to be followed. ATC did not query the error in the crew's estimated time of arrival over the next reporting point nor was there a procedural requirement to do so at the time. ,No,Unknown,N1739D,AEROPLANE,LOCKHEED,DELTA AIR LINES,COMMERCIAL,OVER 272001 KG (599651 LBS),,HEAVY,0,3,NONE,AIR TRANSPORT,CYXU

During landing on runway 07R the aircraft experienced a tail strike due to a hard landing resulting in structural damage requiring a major repair. There were no injuries. The Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority completed an investigation and issued report AAIA 05-2021 on 31st December 2021 (URL: https://www.thb.gov.hk/aaia/doc/Air%20Canada%20AC15%20Final%20Report%2028%20Dec21.pdf) with the following:5. Safety Recommendations Safety Recommendation 12-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider recognition and awareness training for Pilot Induced Oscillation (PIO) during the training process in particular as a component for pilots converting across type. [3.1 (9)]Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada Safety Recommendation 13-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider awareness training for crew qualifying as IOETC to emphasise the requirement to monitor and recognise situations where the control of the aircraft may be compromised. This should also include guidance when the trainee is new to the type. (3.3.4)Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada Safety Recommendation 14-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider reviewing and where necessary revise the unstabilised approach criteria and the requirements for a go around to be carried out setting out the requirements in a clear and unambiguous format to avoid any confusion that flight crew may have in interpreting them and the crew actions required. [3.1 (4)]Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada Safety Recommendation 15-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider reviewing and where necessary revise the formal handover of control criteria contained in the FOM incorporating the method when a pilot takes over control “I have control/you have control” setting out the requirements in a clear and unambiguous format to avoid any confusion that flight crew may have in interpreting them. (2.3.7)Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada  Safety Recommendation 16-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider reviewing and where necessary revise the Sterile Flight Deck criteria contained in the FOM incorporating setting out the requirements in a clear and unambiguous format to avoid any confusion that flight crew may have in interpreting them. [3.1 (10)]Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada Safety Recommendation 17-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider reviewing and where necessary revise the removal of loose objects from the flight deck policy including eating utensils and beverage containers before the top of descent setting out the requirements in a clear and unambiguous format to avoid any confusion that cabin and flight crew may have in interpreting them. (2.3.8)Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada Safety Recommendation 18-2021It is recommended that Air Canada consider incorporating policy and guidelines in the company manual suite regarding the reporting of potentially hazardous occurrences for example a tail strike to the relevant Air Traffic Services in the most expeditious manner setting out the requirements in a clear and unambiguous format to avoid any confusion that flight crew may have in interpreting them. [3.1 (11)]Safety Recommendation Owner: Air Canada 6. Safety Recommendations Already ImplementedOn receipt of the draft report Air Canada proactively addressed all the Safety Recommendations made and after review by the AAIA they are considered closed. Safety Recommendation 12-2021 Air Canada has designed a module on PIO in their Pilot Indoctrination Training course for new pilots so that every new pilot is aware of this phenomenon. This will be implemented prior to their next course. Additionally since currently some pilots may not be aware of this phenomenon information will be included on PIO in their next Annual Recurrent Training (ART) cycle to ensure all pilots will see this material over a 12-month period. Safety Recommendation 13-2021 Air Canada has amended their training manual with guidance for training captains on taking control early in appropriate situations and to be alert for students freezing in tense situations. The simulator training for training captains includes practical training on taking control from a student pilot. Scenarios are included where the student candidate (a check pilot or instructor in this case) will intentionally operate the aircraft in a manner that will necessitate the IOETC to take control of the aircraft. Safety Recommendation 14-2021Air Canada incorporated a new Stable Approach Landing and Go-Around Policy into their FOM in September 2020 which defines crew tasks and responsibilities including guidance for the requirement of a go-around. Safety Recommendation 15-2021Air Canada has amended their procedures to incorporate both cases of control handover. Safety Recommendation 16-2021Air Canada has amended their use of “sterile cockpit principles” and how they are employed during critical phases of flight.  Safety Recommendation 17-2021Air Canada has amended their procedures which now include the requirement to remove or secure loose objects for critical phases of flight. Safety Recommendation 18-2021Air Canada has amended their procedures which now include that in order to reduce the risk of potential safety risks to aircraft or flight operations Flight Crews shall report as soon as possible any hazardous flight condition to ATC such as any observed conditions or events that may cause Foreign Object Damage (FOD).,No,No,C-FITW,AEROPLANE,BOEING,AIR CANADA,COMMERCIAL,OVER 272001 KG (599651 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,HEAVY,2007,2,SUBSTANTIAL,AIR TRANSPORT,CYYZ

The operator did after several requests fill out the HCL Form 1 which was received by the Danish AAIB on 2 May 2000.The flight during which the incident occurred was a charter flight from Iqaluit Canada (CFYB) to Nuuk (BGGH). The aircraft did via Kook Islands NDB (KU 359 KHZ) an approach to runway 23 with circling to runway 05.The following actual weather -METAR- valid for Nuuk Airport was observed at time 2052 UTC:METAR BGGH 162052z 07009kt 5000 ra vcfg sct006 bkn012 02/01 q1000The following runway conditions were measured at time 2130 UTC:Braking action runway 05: 50/50/40 each third measured by TapleymeterRunway covered 100% by 7mm of (very) wet snowTaxiway braking action 50 TapleymeterApron Braking action 20 TapleymeterNuuk AFIS reported the abovementioned data concerning the runway conditions to the flight crew while the aircraft was on final for runway 05.When the aircraft after landing was approximately ¿ down the runway the flight crew observed that there was no breaking effect and the aircraft concurrently began moving to the right.The Commander estimated that there was not enough remaining runway to bring the aircraft to a full stop within the runway limitations using the wheel brakes and at the same time that there was not enough remaining runway left to perform a go-around.The Commander then simultaneously supplied maximum power on engine No. 2 (right engine) and maximum brake pressure on the left brakes.  The aircraft turned 180 degree and came to a full stop with a heading of approximately 220 degrees. The flight crew thereafter taxied the aircraft to the apron.In the AIP for Greenland the following information concerning reporting of ice snow and/or slush is given:\During conditions - when runway is covered by wet ice wet snow and/or slush - the result of measurements and estimates will probably be misleading. In such situations the measurements will be reported unreliable.In SNOWTAM item H the figure \""9\""(=unreliable) followed by the measured friction value and the used instrument will be given. If estimated value figure \""9\"" will be given only.\""In the working instructions for Nuuk airport concerning reporting of ice snow and/or slush the following information is given:\"" If the runway is covered by more than 10% of wet ice snow or slush the measured braking action must be regarded as absolutely unreliable. In such cases \""unreliable\"" followed by the braking action shall be used.\""After completion of preliminary investigations and evaluation of the available data concerning the above-mentioned aircraft incident the Danish AAIB has reached the conclusion that further investigations will not result in recommendations of preventive character or will reveal circumstances of vital importance for flight safety.

THE CAPTAIN POSITIONED THE AIRCRAFT ON THE RUNWAY AND GAVE CONTROL TO THE ACTING FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS FLYING THIS LEG OF THE TRIP.  THE TAKEOFF AND THE FLIGHT BACK TO TORONTO WERE CONSIDERED NORMAL BY ALL THREE FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS.  THE FIRST ABNORMAL INDICATION WAS WHEN THE DRAG LINK (TAIL SKID) LIGHT REMAINED ON  AFTER THE LANDING GEAR WAS DOWN AND LOCKED.  THIS LIGHT IS A DISSAGREEMENT LIGHT AND INDICATES THE DRAG LINK IS NOT IN THE POSITION SELECTED BY THE LANDING GEAR SELECTOR.  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS A DRAG LINK WARNING LIGHT AND THE CREW DECIDED TO CONTINUE WITH THE LANDING. THERE WERE NO OTHER ABNORMAL INDICATIONS AND IT WAS ASSUMED BY THE CREW THE LIGHT WAS LIKELY AN INDICATION ERROR.  THE LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL BUT WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS INSPECTED THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE DRAG LINK WAS MISSING AND THERE WAS SOME ASSOCIATED DAMAGE IN THAT AREA OF THE FUSELAGE.  INITIALLY IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE DRAG LINK HAD FAILED WHEN THE LANDING GEAR WAS SELECTED DOWN DURING THE APPROACH TO TORONTO HOWEVER; THE MISSING SECTION OF THE DRAG LINK WAS SUBSIQUENTLY LOCATED ON RUNWAY 08 AT SAN JUAN.  RUNWAY 08 IS 10000 FEET LONG AND THE COMPANY'S AIRPORT CHART INDICATES THERE IS \ARRESTER GEAR RWY 08\"".  THERE IS NO OTHER INFORMATION ON THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF THE ARRESTER GEAR PRINTED ON THE CHART.  THE LOCATION OF THE CABLE IS SHOWN ON THE JEPPESEN AIRPORT DIAGRAM.THE ARRESTER GEAR ON RUNWAY 08 IS A BAK-12(B) SYSTEM LOCATED 2000 FEET FROM THE END OF THE RUNWAY.  THE INSTALLATION CONSISTS OF A 1.25 INCH CABLE WHICH IS PERMENENTLY LAYING ACROSS THE RUNWAY AND IS HELD 2 INCHES OFF THE RUNWAY SURFACE BY RUBBER DONUTS LOCATED EVERY 3-4 INCHES ALONG THE CABLE.  THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW AIRCRAFT TO CROSS OVER THE CABLE WITHOUT SNAGGING IT.  TWO DAYS AFTER THE OCCURRENCE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CABLE WAS 3-4 FEET OUT OF POSITION DISPLACED TOWARD THE THRESHOLD OF RUNWAY 08.  WHEN THE MISSING SECTION OF THE DRAG LINK WAS RECOVERED AND EXAMINED THERE WERE CABLE MARKS ON THE FORWARD FACE OF THE DRAG LINK.  MOST OF THE PAINT WAS STILL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SKID PLATE WHICH WOULD BE THE PORTION OF THE DRAG LINK WHICH WOULD CONTACT THE RUNWAY IN AN OVER ROTATION SITUATION.  THE CABLE MARKS COVER AN AREA ONE TO FOUR INCHES ABOVE THE LOWEST PORTION OF THE SKID PLATE.THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT 195000 LBS FOR THE TAKEOFF MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT WAS 209418 LBS.  FOR THE TAKEOFF THE CREW WERE USING MAXIMUM POWER WITH FLAPS AT 15 DEGREES.  WITH FLAPS SET TO 15 DEGREES THE AIRCRAFT IS EXPECTED TO LIFT OFF WITH A BODY ATTITUDE OF NINE DEGREES NOSE UP.  WITH FLAPS AT 20 DEGREES THE AIRCRAFT WILL LIFT OFF AT 8.5 DEGREES.  THE DRAG LINK WILL CONTACT THE RUNWAY WHEN THE BODY ANGLE REACHES TEN DEGREES NOSE UP.  DURING A NORMAL TAKEOFF THERE IS VERY LITTLE CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAG LINK AND THE RUNWAY SURFACE.  IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A SINUSOIDAL WAVE ACTION SET UP IN THE CABLE BY THE MAIN WHEELS WHEN THEY RUN OVER THE CABLE.  ANY SUCH MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCES OF CATCHING IT WITH THE DRAG LINK.  NONE OF THE THREE FLIGHT CREW HAD TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF THE ARRESTER GEAR ON THIS OR ANY PREVIOUS FLIGHT INTO OR OUT OF SAN JUAN.

N674PA (Clipper 119) was also proceeding to 52N/50W and both aircraft reported by 52N/50W at the same time and at the same altitude.  The exact distance between the two aircraft at 52N/50W could not be determined.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that an air traffic controller in Madrid ACC gave American 67 the wrong latitude for 50W (52N instead of 50N) and this error was not discovered because in his position reports at 30W and 40W the co-pilot of American 67 mistakenly reported that the aircraft was proceeding to 50N/50W when in fact the aircraft was programmed to proceed to 52N/50W.

The number one engine spooled down and a high exhaust gas temperature was noted. The engine was shut down and the flight diverted to Shannon Ireland where an uneventful single-engine landing was made. The flight time on one engine was 50 minutes. Aer Lingus maintenance personnel at Shannon inspected the engine for damage but this initial inspection did not reveal any damage to the compressor blades. Suspecting a fuel pump main stage failure the fuel pump and fuel control unit (FCU) were changed. A full-power engine run-up was successfully carried out indicating normal operation of the engine and the aircraft was released for a ferry flight to Toronto Ontario. During the ferry flight while climbing through FL 313 the number one engine experienced a momentary surge; all engine parameters before and after the surge were normal. The  aircraft returned to Shannon and Air Canada personnel conducted a borescope inspection of the number one engine compressor which revealed massive high pressure compressor damage. When the engine was disassembled most of the blades in the fifth stage compressor assembly were found to have foreign object damage (FOD). Thirteen minor nicks were also found on the trailing edges of the variable inlet guide vanes. The first broken blade was found on stage seven. The heaviest damage occurred in the eighth and ninth stages where several blades were liberated and where the vanes had partially disintegrated. The nicks and tears on the blades and vanes had a circular impact pattern of approximately the diameter of a 12-point bolt; this type of bolt is used in the buildup of the engine. Inspection of the compressor revealed blades and vanes at various stages of failure progression; some of the vanes were broken off and jammed between the inner and outer shrouds. The failure  pattern indicated that compressor blade damage due to FOD had occurred sometime prior to the first engine surge. This observation was based on the presence of dull nicks and airflow-induced dirt deposits on the nicked blades. The failure of the blades and vanes showed a very clear and shiny break surface which indicated fatigue failure originating from the nicks. The original fuel pump was tested and it passed the performance test without adjustment or repair. The original FCU was installed on an engine for a test cell run and it operated within acceptable limits. The initial compressor damage was the result of FOD probably a bolt which entered the engine. This occurred at some time prior to the first engine problem and resulted in the later fatigue failure of the vanes and blades. During the flight from St. John's to London a nicked blade most likely in stage seven suffered fatigue failure and when it separated it caused the engine to spool down. On  departure for the intended ferry flight to Toronto further blade and vane failures occurred causing the engine to surge. Following this incident Air Canada introduced routine post-test compressor borescope inspections to reduce the possibility of similar failures. FINDINGS: Cause Related: 1. The initial inspection by Aer Lingus did not reveal any damage to the compressor blades. 2. The initial engine damage was a result of foreign object damage. 3. The engine spool down and compressor surge occurred when blades and vanes were liberated because of fatigue failure.

THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED TWICE DAMAGING THE NOSE WHEEL STRUCTURE WHICH ULTIMATELY FAILED. THE AIRCRAFT SLID 2000 FT ON THE NOSE SECTION AND MAIN WHEELS BEFORE COMING TO REST ON THE RUNWAY 4100 FT FROM THE THRESHOLD. THE FIRST OFFICER WAS AT THE CONTROLS AND HAD ESTABLISHED A STABILIZED APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY USING THE VASIS FOR VISUAL GLIDE PATH REFERENCE. THE BUG SPEEDS HAD BEEN SET AT 138 KTS FOR A MAXIMUM LANDING WEIGHT OF 190000 LBS. THE APPROACH WAS ACCURATELY FLOWN AND THE AIRCRAFT CROSSED THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD IN THE FLAP 50 LANDING CONFIGURATION AT THE PRESCRIBED 148 KIAS USING NORMAL APPROACH POWER SETTINGS. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS 550 FT BEYOND THE THRESHOLD THE CAPTAIN CALLED \PLUS 10\"" AT WHICH TIME THE FIRST OFFICER COMMENCED REDUCING POWER. THE CAPTAIN IMMEDIATELY CALLED A \""DECREASING\"" AIR SPEED AND NOTED THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WAS NOT INCREASING POWER OR DECK  ANGLE TO RECTIFY A DEVELOPING HIGH SINK RATE. LESS THAN ONE SECOND LATER THE AIRCRAFT SETTLED HEAVILY TO THE RUNWAY ON THE MAIN WHEELS 1100 FT FROM THE THRESHOLD. THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED 30 FT INTO THE AIR AND CONTACTED THE RUNWAY A SECOND TIME IN A LEVEL ATTITUDE 200 FT FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT THEN BOUNCED INTO THE AIR A SECOND TIME FOR A DISTANCE OF 300 FT BEFORE STRIKING THE RUNWAY IN A NOSE LOW ATTITUDE 1550 FT FROM THE THRESHOLD. THIS FINAL IMPACT INITIATED FAILURE OF THE NOSE GEAR STRUCTURE WHICH WAS DRIVEN VERTICALLY UPWARD DEFORMING THE CABIN FLOOR IMMEDIATELY AFT OF THE FLIGHT DECK DOOR. THIS DEFORMATION JAMMED THE THRUST REVERSER AND ENGINE SHUT-OFF CONTROLS WHICH ARE ROUTED UNDER THE FLOOR AT THIS POINT AND ALSO OBSTRUCTED MOVEMENT OF THE FLIGHT DECK DOOR. NOSE GEAR HARDWARE BEGAN FALLING TO THE RUNWAY SURFACE AND THE CAPTAIN TOOK CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT. A SLIGHT NOSE-UP ATTITUDE WAS MOMENTARILY ATTAINED AS THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED ON THE MAIN WHEELS  BEFORE IT ASSUMED A LEVEL THREE POINT ATTITUDE. THE AIRCRAFT HAD ROLLED AN ADDITIONAL 500 FT DOWN THE RUNWAY CENTRE LINE SCATTERING NOSE GEAR HARDWARE AS IT PROGRESSED UNTIL THE ENTIRE NOSE GEAR WHEEL WELL BOX ASSEMBLY FAILED REARWARD AND UPWARD WITH THE NOSE GEAR STILL IN THE DOWN AND LOCKED POSITION. THE ENTIRE NOSE GEAR STRUCTURE FAILED 45 DEG REARWARD WITH A SLIGHT ANGLE TO THE RIGHT. THE NOSE WHEELS CONTINUED TO ROTATE WHICH CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO VEER TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. THE CREW APPLIED HARSH LEFT BRAKE TO PREVENT THE AIRCRAFT FROM LEAVING THE RUNWAY AS THE RIGHT MAIN WHEELS TRACKED WITHIN THREE FT OF THE RUNWAY EDGE. THE AIRCRAFT SLID ON THE NOSE SECTION AND MAIN WHEELS FOR 2000 FT DURING WHICH THE CAPTAIN ATTEMPTED TO APPLY REVERSE THRUST HOWEVER THE LEVERS HAD JAMMED. THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST ON THE RUNWAY CENTRE LINE FACING 30 DEG LEFT OF RUNWAY HEADING 4100 FT FROM THE THRESHOLD. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT STOPPED THE CAPTAIN ORDERED AN  EMERGENCY EVACUATION USING THE PA SYSTEM AND ATTEMPTED TO SHUT DOWN ALL FOUR ENGINES. HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO CUT ENGINES ONE AND FOUR; THE CUT-OFF LEVERS FOR ENGINES 2 AND 3 WERE JAMMED \""ON\"". ALL FOUR FIRE HANDLES WERE THEN PULLED WHICH CUT THE ENGINE FUEL SUPPLY OFF AT THE TANK. THE TWO INBOARD ENGINES CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL THE FUEL IN THE LINES WAS CONSUMED. THE CAPTAIN'S CODED EMERGENCY EVACUATION ORDER WHICH WAS DIRECTED TO THE CABIN ATTENDANTS WAS NOT HEARD IN THE CABIN AREA DUE TO FAILURE OF THE PA SYSTEM. DAMAGE SUSTAINED TO THE ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATION JUNCTION BOXES LOCATED IN THE NOSE GEAR AREA HAD DISRUPTED THE INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. THE FLIGHT ENGINEER ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE FLIGHT DECK DOOR AND UPON FINDING IT RESTRAINED BY THE DEFORMED FLOOR PROMPTLY KICKED IT OFF ITS HINGES AND ADVISED THE CABIN ATTENDANTS TO INITIATE THE PASSENGER EVACUATION DRILL. ALL PASSENGERS AND CREW EVENTUALLY EVACUATED THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH THIS EXIT IN A REASONABLY  ORDERLY MANNER CONSIDERING THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE PA SYSTEM. DURING THE EVACUATION A MALE PASSENGER CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF A CABIN ATTENDANT WHO WAS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY IN OPENING THE RIGHT FORWARD GALLEY DOOR. THE DOOR HAD BEEN PARTIALLY OPENED BY THE CABIN ATTENDANT AND WAS THEN PARTIALLY CLOSED BY THE PASSENGER. DURING CYCLING OF THE DOOR THE ARMED ESCAPE SLIDE WAS PULLED FROM ITS CONTAINER AND COMMENCED TO INFLATE WITHIN THE GALLEY MOMENTARILY PINNING THE PASSENGER AGAINST THE FORWARD GALLEY BULKHEAD. THE SLIDE SUSTAINED A GASH DURING INFLATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEFLATED TO THE GALLEY FLOOR. DETAILED ANALYSIS OF FLIGHT RECORDER DATA REVEALED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLOWN AT RECOMMENDED SPEEDS UNTIL THE LANDING FLARE AND WITH A RELATIVELY MINOR DECREASE IN POWER THE SPEED DECREASED SHARPLY; AFTER ABOUT 2 SECONDS THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN HEAVILY. THE SUDDEN DECREASE IN SPEED IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENCE OF A DECREASING HEADWIND TYPE OF WIND SHEAR.

During the take-off roll from the unprepared surface (position S71 55.3 E008 17.9) for the return leg to Novo runway (Novolazarevskaya Antarctica) the aircraft contacted a snow drift and became airborne with insufficient speed to sustain flight. The aircraft stalled and contacted the surface with sufficient force to collapse the main landing gear. The aircraft came to rest on its belly sustaining substantial damage. Two passengers received minor injuries. The crew and passengers were accommodated in tents until a second Kenn Borek DC3-T arrived later in the day. More details to follow.Update: The Kenn Borek Air Wheel-ski equipped DC3-T C-GEAI had attempted a downhill off strip ski takeoff run in its landing tracks with a tailwind which proved unsuccessful due to lack of airspeed attained. A second attempt uphill into wind was carried out on the snow covered surface. C-GEAI had accelerated to 60 knots when it came into contact with a hard snow drift which caused the aircraft to yaw left and become airborne. When C-GEAI stalled and contacted the surface both main gears were sheared off resulting in major damage to propellers (Hartzell HC-B5MA-3A) engines (Pratt & Whitney PT6-67R) and airframe.Update - Feb. 13 2013 - Prior to the first landing of the season at Holtanna Glacier an over flight was conducted to assess the snow conditions and choose appropriate location. The conditions appeared satisfactory and the landing was carried out without incident. The landing roll was rougher than expected from the over flight visual. The landing site was then marked with snow filled bags to aid in subsequent landings. Drifts were noticed during this effort but true size was concealed by soft snow.During the take-off roll engine power was set to 110% torque. As the take-off roll continued the torque setting was noticed at 121% when it was reduced to 110% seconds before impact with the drift.

As the pilot gradually descended and at a height of about 10 feet above the ground he experienced significant binding in the flight controls.  The pilot was unable to rectify the control binding and had considerable difficulty maintaining attitude and altitude control of the helicopter.During 15 seconds of random uncontrolled hover flight the helicopter turned and climbed to about 20 feet whereupon the pilot retarded the throttle lever causing the main rotor rpm to decay rapidly.  As a result the helicopter descended quickly struck the ground bounced and landed upright causing substantial damage to the skids the tail boom and the main rotor head.  The pilot was not injured and the impact forces were insufficient to activate the ELT.UPDATE: 01 FEBRUARY 2008THE BOARD AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT ON 28 JUNE 2007.The accident occurred during good daylight and in visual meteorological conditions.  The accident site is located at 05.53'N and 060.37'W - about 254 degrees magnetic and 145 nm from Georgetown - and is 1600 feet above mean sea level.The State of Occurrence Guyana has delegated the investigation to Canada in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 and the investigation is being conducted in Vancouver BC with the assistance from representatives from BEA France Eurocopter France and Canada and the operator.TSB Findings3.0 Conclusions3.1 Finding as to Causes and Contributing Factors1. The helicopter had a flight control malfunction and the pilot was unable to effectively control the helicopter before it collided with the terrain. The cause of the malfunction could not be determined with certainty but was most likely a loss of hydraulic pressure.3.2 Findings as to Risk1. The hydraulic cut-off (HYD CUT OFF) switch is underrated for its application in theAS 350 and as a result is exposed to higher-than-design electrical current drawleading to intermittent function and premature failure. Failure of the switch can leadto improper operation of the hydraulic system or warning devices.2. The two printed circuit boards (22-alpha and 30-alpha) in the centre pedestal werecontaminated by debris accumulation. This could lead to an electrical short-circuitresulting in a malfunction of the hydraulic system and its warning systems.3. The main rotor hydraulic servo actuators were out-of-tolerance for extension andretraction rates and internal leakage a circumstance that may cause asymmetric servooperation.4. The lateral hydraulic servo accumulators differed remarkably in the time required toexhaust them of hydraulic pressure leading to asymmetric servo operation.5. The hydraulic test (HYD TEST) switch is vulnerable to inadvertent operation that hasbeen shown to cause loss of control of the helicopter. The helicopter manufacturer hasissued a voluntary Service Bulletin to install a protective cover device over theHYD TEST switch to prevent inadvertent operation. Without the cover the risk ofunintentional use is always present.6. The aural warning horn to alert the pilot of low main rotor speed also functions as the low hydraulic pressure warning a situation that leads to ambiguity and potentiallyinappropriate response to the actual emergency.7. The gross particulate contamination found in the hydraulic system fluid presents aclear risk of servo malfunction and could lead to loss of control; the source of thecontamination was not found.8. Although the AS 350 B2 can be controlled without hydraulic servo actuators itrequires the pilot to exert considerable muscular effort which is difficult to gaugeaccurately. The required effort may exceed the physical strength or endurance ofsome pilots.9. The lack of a requirement for recurrent AS 350 training may result in unacceptableloss of familiarity with the emergency procedures a loss of awareness of hydraulicsystem malfunctions and the unusually high control forces that result. Collectivelythese issues could result in a loss-of-control situation.,No,Unknown,C-GNMJ,HELICOPTER,EUROCOPTER,VIH,COMMERCIAL,0-2250 KG       (0-4960 LBS),SKID,LIGHT,1994,1,SUBSTANTIAL,HELISLINGING,

The aircraft was due overhead Gisborne around 1415 with an ETA at Palmerston North of 1520.There was an initial \scratchy\"" contact at about 1440 with ATS which indicated that the pilot was unsure of his position and then radio contact was lost. New Zealand SAR services declared an emergency and set about trying to locate the aircraft. A USAF aircraft en route to New Zealand was diverted and it sighted the Convair which was well to the East of the expected position and off course. The USAF pilot gave the Convair pilot a course for Gisborne NZ. The crew were requested to activate the ELT and another aircraft despatched from Gisborne to home in on it and guide the Convair back to Gisborne.The Convair landed safely at Gisborne but with very little fuel remaining.  A NZ military aircraft and a helicopter were on stand-by in case the Convair was forced to ditch.UPDATED: 25 AUGUST 2004THE BOARD AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT ON 07 JULY 2004.SummaryThe Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter Ltd. Convair 580 aircraft registration C-GKFJ serial number 114 was on a delivery flight to its new owners in New Zealand. On board were two Canadian pilots and a ground engineer from New Zealand. On 15 June 2003 the aircraft left Kelowna British Columbia for Honolulu Hawaii where the crew rested for 29 hours. The aircraft departed Honolulu on June 16 at 0930 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and stopped to refuel in Pago Pago American Samoa on June 17 at 1820 UTC. It took off at 2040 UTC for the intended destination of Palmerston North (PN) New Zealand via waypoints BAVAK RUGRO FAROA AUTEL IBESO the GS (Gisborne) very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) the WO non-directional beacon and the NR VOR. The aircraft was at flight level 200 with an estimated flight time of 6 hours 28 minutes an estimated fuel burn of 12 000 pounds and 18 200 pounds of fuel on board.After passing AUTEL the aircraft deviated to the east of its intended track and the crew became lost about 300 nautical miles to the east of Gisborne New Zealand. The aircraft eventually landed at Gisborne with very little fuel remaining.Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors1.	The last six waypoints of the flight plan from Pago Pago to Palmerston North were entered into both GPSs with west longitude instead of east longitude resulting in the GPS directing the aircraft to positions east of the 180  meridian.2.	The crew did not check GPS data against flight plan data either pre-flight or en route during waypoint passage and so did not detect the significant differences between GPS and flight plan tracks and distances of the last six waypoints.3.	North American data cards were inserted in both GPSs resulting in the internal databases of airports and VORs being deactivated and unavailable to the crew.4.	The crew was unaware that removing the North American data card would have reactivated the GPS internal databases of airports and VORs including all those in New Zealand. This would have resolved the crew's uncertainty about their position.5.	The crew received no special training on the Apollo 820 GPS or briefing on long-range navigation procedures. Therefore they were unprepared to detect a navigational error caused by incorrect data input to the GPS.Findings as to Risk1.	Instrument approach and airport charts for Gisborne were not available to the crew placing them at risk when a diversion to Gisborne became necessary.Other Findings1.	The necessity for numerous deviations east of track after AUTEL to avoid thunderstorms in the intertropical front may have masked  the obvious direction change after IBESO.""",No,Unknown,C-GKFJ,AEROPLANE,CONVAIR,KELOWNA FLIGHTCRAFT,COMMERCIAL,5701-27000 KG   (12566-59525 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,MEDIUM,1953,2,NONE,FERRY,

The flight was en route from Cologne Germany with a refuelling stop at Gander Newfoundland to Havana Cuba.  The crew reported their position at 40 degrees west to the Gander Flight Service Station (FSS).  They reported at flight level (FL) 350 and requested descent to FL 310.  Gander FSS advised the crew to standby on their request for a lower altitude.  Approximately 11 minutes later CU 9343 reported level at FL 310.  During the descent CU 9343 lost separation with two other aircraft.  The other aircraft comprised an eastbound flight at FL 330 (separation was approximately one minute opposite direction) and a westbound flight at FL 310 (separation was one minute with 25 nautical miles lateral separation). CU 9343 was in radio contact with Gander FSS on 13291 kHz on the high frequency (HF) band.  Neither Gander Area Control Centre (ACC) nor Gander FSS issued a clearance to CU 9343 to descend to FL 310.

There was no response to thrust lever movement and after a short period of time there was uncommanded engine shut down (GE CF6-80C2B6F). The crew was unsuccessful in restarting the engine and declared an emergency. ARFF was standing by for the uneventful landing. The #2 engine was recently installed on the aircraft after being in storage. The engine had arrived at Air Canada without an HMU. An HMU was received from the vendor and installed on the engine sometime prior to the engine being installed on the aircraft. Engine ground runs were performed and no faults were found and the aircraft was returned to service. After the occurrence maintenance found fuel leaking from the flange on the fuel line from the HMU to the fuel flow transmitter. When the line was disconnected the remnants of a yellow shipping cap were found. The cap had not been removed prior to installation and when the fuel line was connected it was squeezed between the fuel line flange and HMU. In the process of torquing down the flange bolts the cap had deformed the seal on the flange and after a few hours of operation the heat from normal engine operation deformed the softer cap and the leak developed. The cap material was soft and fuel pressure from the HMU would be sufficient to rupture the center section of the cap and allow fuel to flow. When the operator investigated the event they found that due to the curvature of the line at this location it would have been difficult to observe the shipping cap. Air Canada does not use this type of cap on their fuel lines and maintenance was not expecting to find one inside the line. Air Canada will be issuing notices to their maintenance staff to prevent this type of event from re-occurring.,No,Unknown,C-GEOU,AEROPLANE,BOEING,AIR CANADA,COMMERCIAL,27001-272000 KG (59526-599650 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,HEAVY,1999,2,NONE,AIR TRANSPORT,CYYZ

The controller completed a trial probe to determine if separation would be maintained between the aircraft. The controller then cleared AMX0005 to FL390 at which time separation between the aircraft eroded to approximately 7 minutes longitudinally where 10 minutes longitudinal or 1000 feet vertical is required. By the time the error was discovered required separation had been regained.The method the controller used for the trial probe is for use in a radar controlled environment by flight planners prior to the aircraft entering oceanic airspace. Included in this method is a sliding Mach scale which is used when the leading aircraft is faster thus assuring separation as both aircraft progress. This allows the aircraft to enter oceanic airspace without the required 10 minute longitudinal separation.

About two minutes after the crew ceased cross-feeding due to a fuel imbalance the left engine experienced a total loss of power. About one minute later the co-pilot indicated to the pilot-in-command (PIC) that the airplane was losing airspeed and about 15 seconds later the co-pilot remarked \keep it up keep it up.\"" Shortly thereafter the airplane departed controlled flight and impacted terrain. The airplane was destroyed by fire and impact forces. Examination of the left engine revealed no evidence of any pre-impact failures that would have accounted for an uncommanded in-flight shut-down. A SIGMET for potential severe clear icing was effective for airplane's flight path; however the flight crew did not report or discuss any weather related problems around the time of the accident. At the time of the accident the airplane was above its single-engine service ceiling. The PIC had accumulated approximately 6000 hours of total flight experience of which about 500 hours were as PIC in make and model. The co-pilot had approximately 600 hours of total fight experience of which 300 hours were in make and model. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows. The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain minimum control airspeed which resulted in a loss of control. Factors in this accident were clouds and a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons while in cruise flight above the airplane's single engine service ceiling.

He received a PPC on January 14 2000.The co-pilot held a current Category I Canadian Medical Certificate which was issued on November 26 1999. AIRCRAFT INFORMATION Review of the airplane maintenance records revealed that Airwave Transport purchased the accident airplane from North American Airlines Ltd. Calgary Alberta Canada in November 1999. On November 6 1999 the airplane was flown for 4.5 hours from the Calgary International Airport Calgary Alberta Canada to Toronto. Prior to that flight the airplane's most recent flight was conducted on July 17 1998.The airplane was maintained by Airwave Transport under an approved manufacturer inspection program and was most recently inspected on July 10 2000. The airplane had an accumulated total airframe time of 22046.7 hours and 15452 cycles.The accident airplane was equipped with two Rolls-Royce Dart 529-8X model turbo-propeller engines and two Dowty CR184-4-30-4-50 model propellers.The left engine and right engines were installed on the accident airplane on July 18 1990 and May 6 1997 respectively. The propellers were installed on the left and right accident engines on June 1 2000 and April 21 1998 respectively.At the time of the accident the left engine and right engine had accumulated about 3861 and 5389 hours since overhaul respectively. Review of the engine logbook records revealed an engine performance run was completed on July 7 2000. No anomalies were reported on either engine.On July 11 and 15 2000 the airplane was test flown by the PIC of the accident flight for 1 hour each. A company dispatch agent occupied the co-pilot seat during the July 15 test flight. The company dispatch agent stated that he held a commercial pilot's license and he had received 2-weeks of ground instruction and 5 hours of simulator training for the G-1. He did not hold a G-1 type rating. The dispatch agent stated that the test flight lasted about an hour and he did not observe any discrepancies with the airplane; nor did the PIC give any indication of any problems. Additionally he recalled that the weather radar was tested and worked properly.The accident flight occurred during the third leg of the airplane's first courier trip. The accident flight crew departed Toronto on July 17 2000 and arrived Halifax Nova Scotia about 0300. Airwave Transport maintained an apartment in Halifax for flight crew personnel. The flight crew departed Halifax about 2145 and landed in Moncton about 2210.While in Halifax the PIC informed company personnel that he had experienced no problems during the flight and was \""very happy\"" with the airplane's performance.METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATIONPrior to the flight the accident flight crew received a weather-briefing package via fax which included in-flight advisories PIREPS wind and temperature aloft forecasts weather observations and forecasts for selected Canadian and U.S airports.A weather observation taken at the Houlton International Airport (HUL) Houlton Maine at 0049 reported: wind from 230 degrees at 5 knots visibility 8 miles ceiling 600 feet overcast temperature and dew point 57 degrees Fahrenheit altimeter 29.71 in/hg.A Safety Board Meteorology Factual Report was prepared for this accident.According to the Meteorologist's Factual Report Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite number 8 (GOES-8) data issued at 0015 depicted a low to mid-altitude overcast cloud layer over the Houlton area and the accident site. The radiative temperatures in an approximately 50-mile area around Houlton corresponded to cloud heights which ranged from 14500 feet to 26000 feet. The mean cloud top and the cloud tops over the accident site were about 19000 feet. The Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) issued Gander (CYQX) SIGMET Bravo 6 at 0030 which was valid from 0035 to 0435. The SIGMET covered airspace which included the airplane's flight path and the accident site. The SIGMET was issued for a broken line of cumulonimbus clouds with tops to 40000 feet observed and forecast with the potential for severe turbulence and severe clear icing. The line of thunderstorms was identified as moving eastward at 5 knots with little change expected in intensity.There were no pilot reports over Maine for icing or turbulence recorded by the National Weather Service between 2000 and 0400.According to interviews with company representatives and former company pilots it was normal procedure for a flight crew to obtain a \""weather package\"" from company dispatch personnel. However the flight crew was responsible for updating and obtaining any additional weather information as needed through air traffic control and flight service stations. The company dispatcher's did not have any operational authority for the conduct of the flight and the flight crew made all \""go no-go\"" decisions. FLIGHT RECORDERSThe airplane was equipped with an L3 Communications cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The CVR was recovered from the accident site and forwarded to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorders Division Washington DC. A CVR group convened on August 3 2000 and a transcript of the entire 31:16 minute recording was prepared. Elapsed Times (ET) of the CVR transmissions were expressed in minutes and seconds from the beginning of the CVR recording; however when compared to ATC transcripts it was noted that the times expressed in the CVR transcript were about 30 seconds beyond EDT.At elapsed time 14:16 the co-pilot indicated he began to cross-feed fuel from the right fuel tank to correct a fuel imbalance. The cross feeding continued until about 27:11. At that time the co-pilot stated \""...turn that crossfeed off now...that all right with you?\"" and the PIC replied \""yup.\""The following are excerpts from the CVR transcript:29:16 A sound similar to decrease in propeller RPM29:20 the co-pilot stated \""we got an engine failure number one\""29:27 the PIC stated \""carry out the drill\""29:41 co-pilot stated \""feathered.

The depth of the crater was estimated to be approximately 5 feet deep. The banks of the river were lined with 60 to 70 foot tall trees. On the northeast rim of the crater a small grouping of trees was uprooted and rested horizontal on a 020-degree heading. Several trees on the southern side of the crater were leaning away from the crater. None of the upper portions of the trees in the accident site area were damaged.The airplane was severely fragmented and fire damaged. All major portions of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The majority of the wreckage was north and west of the crater within 100 feet. Small and lightweight fragments of the airplane were found in all directions from the crater to a radius of approximately 500 feet. Standing fuel and oil were observed in the crater and leaching out of the ground into the river throughout the site.The right wing was at the southeast edge of the crater. The wing was severely fire damaged and the majority of the upper wing skin was consumed. Approximately 2 feet of the wing tip and spar cap was observed broken into several pieces in close proximity. The majority of the wing leading edge was missing forward of the main spar. Chord wise compression buckling was observed on the lower and upper skin that was not consumed. The aileron and spring tab were present but fractured in several pieces.The left wing was broken into several sections. The inboard portion of the wing was found approximately 30 feet southwest from the crater. The inboard wing section was severely fire damaged with the major portion of the upper and lower skin consumed. The wing leading edge forward of the main spar was not located. The upper and lower skin aft of the main spar exhibited signs of chord wise compression buckling. The wing tip was separated outboard of the flap actuator. The outboard portion of the wing was fragmented with its major portions found at 40 feet and 210 degrees and 50 feet and 220 degrees from the crater.The right horizontal stabilizer was on the southwest side of the crater attached to the vertical stabilizer and aft fuselage tail cone structure. The right horizontal stabilizer sustained severe impact and fire damage. The majority of the upper skin outboard tip and right elevator were consumed by fire. The lower skin and leading edge exhibited significant chord wise compression buckling. The left elevator trim tab was separated from the elevator in two pieces and was located in the vicinity of the stabilizer. Additionally the trim tab was severely fire damaged.The left horizontal stabilizer was separated from the empennage structure and also found in two pieces. A portion of the inboard stabilizer and elevator was located at 20 feet and 210 degrees from the crater. The leading edge was severely crushed and the upper and lower skin exhibited significant chord wise compression buckling. The outboard stabilizer and elevator were 30 feet and 225 degrees from the crater. The tip leading edge showed chord wise compression buckling with small fragments of wood lodged in the structure.The vertical stabilizer main spar was attached to the aft fuselage tail cone and empennage structure on the west side of the crater. The majority of the rudder and stabilizer was consumed by the post impact fire.Portions of the airplane's deicing boots remained attached to sections of each wing leading edge and both sides of the horizontal stabilizer leading edge. It could not be determined whether the boots were inflated or deflated at impact. None of the cockpit deice controls were recovered.All four trim actuators were recovered and their cables were observed in the middle position of their respective trim actuator drums.The airplane's ailerons elevators and rudder were manually controlled through cables bell cranks and pushrods. The ailerons were mechanically boosted by spring tabs. The left aileron incorporated a manual trim tab. The rudder utilized a combination of mechanical spring tabs and manual trim. Portions of all control surfaces were located at the accident site; however control system continuity could not be determined due to the severely fragmented nature of the wreckage.The cockpit area was destroyed by impact forces. Small fragments of the cockpit structure and instrument panels were located in the northern quadrant of the impact crater.Both engines were separated from the airframe and exhibited extensive fire and impact damage. The right engine was on the north side of the crater separated into two sections and on top of an uprooted tree. The left engine was in the stream northwest of the crater. About a 30-degree arc of what appeared to be the 1st stage impeller vanes from the left engine were curled back. Several other impeller vanes exhibited individual non-uniform deformation. The impeller vanes from the right engine were not visible.The left engine propeller was partially imbedded in the ground beneath the river. Two blades protruded from the water and appeared to be in a feathered or near feathered position. All four-propeller blades were recovered from the left engine. All four-propeller blades were recovered from the right engine. The blades were all separated from the hub which was not recovered. One blade exhibited \""S\"" bending two blades were twisted approximately 80 to 90 degrees in the direction opposite of rotation and one bladed contained minor nicks and scratches on its leading and trailing edges. Both engines and propellers were retained for further examination and a Safety Board Powerplant Group was convened on August 16 2000 in Plainville Connecticut.Examination of the left engine and propeller revealed that the engine was not rotating and the propeller blades were within several degrees of the feathered position at the time of impact. The right engine exhibited considerable rotational damage in both the compressor and turbine sections. The right engine propeller hub was not recovered; subsequently the right propeller blades pitch angle was not determined. It was noted that all four-propeller blades exhibited bending and airfoil.Fractured pieces of the left engine drive shafts were sent to the Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for evaluation. According to the Metallurgist's Factual Report examinations of all the fracture surfaces were typical of bending or tensile overload. No evidence of torsional fractures or any preexisting fractures that would account for the uncommanded in-flight shut-down of the left engine were observed.The engine driven fuel pumps and fuel system boost pumps were not recovered.MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATIONA pathological examination was performed on the pilot and co-pilot on July 24 2000 by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Augusta Maine.Toxicological testing of the flight crew was conducted by the FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory Oklahoma City Oklahoma.ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATIONGeneralAccording to information received from Transport Canada Airwave Transportation Inc. (Airwave Transport) was a commercial aviation company formed in 1991. The company held an Air Operator Certificate according to CAR 705 and CAR 704 requirements. They offered non-scheduled freight air service from its main operating base at the Lester B. Pearson International Airport Toronto Canada (CYYZ) and a sub-base at CYUL. At the time of the accident Airwave operated two G-1 airplanes from CYYZ and one Convair 580 from CYUL. The operations department consisted of approximately 20 personnel.The company also held an Approved Maintenance Organization Certificate. Aircraft maintenance was performed \""in-house\"" at both bases. A full-time maintenance department consisted of four Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AME) in Toronto two AMEs in Dorval and additional support staff. The aircraft technical records were kept at the main base in Toronto. On August 20 2001 Airwave Transport voluntarily surrendered their operating certificate to Transport Canada.OversightIn August 2000 Airwave Transport underwent a Special Purpose Audit by Transport Canada. The scope of the audit encompassed specific activities that could affect the safe operation of the company which included but not limited to airworthiness and related programs; flight operations and the operational control system; and training. The audit identified 12 non-conformances; however according to a representative of Transport Canada's System Safety Office there were no violations issued to Airwave Transport as a result of the audit findings.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONSound Spectrum StudyThe audio captured by the CVR was examined to document any background noise which may have been associated with the operation of the airplane's engine(s).According to a Safety Board Vehicle Recorder Specialist examination of data extracted from a spectrogram of the cockpit area microphone (CAM) suggested that the propeller and engine speed began to increase approximately 6 seconds after the other engine failed. The propeller speed increased from about 1314 RPM to a peak of about 1344 RPM then decreased to about 1325 RPM where it remained constant. No other notable changes were recorded. RadarThe accident airplane had been assigned a transponder code of 6740. Radar data obtained from the FAA revealed the accident airplane was level at 16000 feet for about 1.5 minutes. At 0029:19 the airplane descended to 15900 feet. The airplane was then level at 15800 feet for at least 24 seconds during which time; the flight crew requested vectors to the nearest airport and reported the airplane could not maintain altitude. Twelve seconds later the airplane's altitude was 15600 feet and the transponder code was changed to 7700. The final radar target was observed 12 seconds later at 0030:07 at an altitude of 14900 feet and was followed by the flight crew transmitting they had lost control. Single-Engine PerformanceBased on atmospheric conditions and weight and balance information the airplanes single-engine service ceiling was estimated to be about 14000 feet.The FAA \""Airplane Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-3\"" defined single-engine service ceiling as: \""The maximum density altitude at which the single-engine best rate of climb speed will produce a 50 feet-per-minute (FPM) rate of climb. This ceiling is determined by the manufacturer on the basis of the airplane's maximum gross weight flaps and landing gear retracted the critical engine inoperative and the propeller feathered.\"" FAA-H-8083-3 further stated \""When the airplane is above its single engine service ceiling altitude will be lost.... The altitude should be maintained if it is within the capability of the airplane. If the airplane is not capable of maintaining altitude with an engine inoperative under existing circumstances the airspeed should be maintained at the single-engine best rate-of-climb speed so as to conserve altitude as long as possible to reach a suitable landing area.\""Fuel System (Description)The G-1 fuel system consisted of two integral wing tanks each with a capacity of about 775 gallons (5231 pounds) four fuel pumps (two for each tank) one cross-feed valve four check valves two fuel heaters two fuel filters and two engine driven fuel pumps (one each engine). During normal operation the fuel pumps provided pressurized fuel to the on-side engine-driven fuel pump through the check valves fuel heater and fuel filter. The fuel then proceeded to the engine driven fuel pump to the fuel control and finally to the fuel nozzles for combustion in the burner cans. The fuel pumps were controlled via rocker switches in the cockpit. All four boost pumps should be selected to the \""ON\"" position for the takeoff descent approach and landing phases of flight. One boost pump from each tank should be selected to the \""ON\"" position for the climb and cruise phases of flight. The cross-feed of fuel was accomplished by selecting all four boost pump switches to the \""ON\"" position opening the cross-feed valve and then selecting the two fuel boost pump switches to the \""OFF\"" position for the fuel tank not to be used. To cease cross-feeding the flight crew should first select all fuel boost pumps to the \""ON\"" position before reconfiguring the fuel system. During normal operation the fuel tank boost pumps provided low-pressure fuel to the engine driven pumps where the fuel pressure was increased before it reached the fuel nozzles and the burner cans for combustion. In the event that both boost pumps were inoperative or failed in one tank then the engine driven pumps solely provided the engine fuel to sustain operation; however it would not do so during all operating conditions.The Flight Safety International Gulfstream I recurrent training manual emergency/abnormal procedures checklist stated the engine would operate normally below an altitude of 8000 feet with two boost pumps on the same side off or failed and would probably operate normally up to an altitude of 20000 feet provided rapid power lever movement is avoided. However above an altitude of 20000 feet the decreased fuel pressure would most likely result in engine flameout if corrective action were not taken.According to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) limitations section one operating fuel pump is required for engine operation. With regards to two-fuel boost pumps inoperative in one tank the AFM stated \""Engines should operate without boost pumps below 8000 ft;\"" however the AFM did not discuss operation above 8000 feet.Engine IcingThe G-1 Flight Manual Appendix A Adverse Weather/Abnormal Atmospheric Conditions section stated in part:\""Engine/propeller icing can occur without wing icing. A turbine engine operating in an air mass with an ambient temperature below 8-deegrees C may experience engine icing; this is caused by the temperature drop associated with the reduction in pressure between that of the air mass and the pressure at the propeller disk and/or first stages of the compressor. As air is drawn past the propeller or into the engine moisture condenses into droplets. Theses droplets due to their inertia cannot follow the airflow around the propeller guide vanes or compressor blades. Instead they strike the metal parts and freeze....\""Anti-Ice SystemThe G-1 utilized second-stage bleed air to inflate deicing boots on the leading edges of the wings horizontal and vertical stabilizers. A two-cycle timer controlled cycling of the boots (one minute for heavy ice and four minutes for light ice). Manual cycling could also be initiated by the flight crew. Empennage boot operation was indicated by advisory lights. Additionally wing boot operation was visible to the flight crew. Each engine and propeller blade were also deiced. The propeller blades spinner and engine intake area were electrically deiced by its respective engine-driven alternator and controlled by a two-cycle timer.Wreckage ReleaseThe airplane wreckage was released on July 27 2001 to a representative of the owners insurance company.

THE PILOT CONDUCTED A SUCCESSFUL ENGINE-OUT AUTOROTATION IN THE MOUNTAINOUS AREA BUT THE HELICOPTER SUBSEQUENTLY SLID DOWN A RAVINE. THE TAIL SECTION REPORTEDLY BROKE OFF AND THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE TO THE REMAINDER OF THE AIRFRAME IS SIGNIFICANT. THE OCCUPANTS WERE NOT INJURED.THE MANUFACTURER AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAVE BEEN ADVISED. THE MAINTENANCE ENGINEER WILL RETURN TO THE SITE TO TAKE PHOTOS AND HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE ENGINE. THE OWNER WILL ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE ENGINE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE HELICOPTER FROM THE SITE AND HAVE THE ENGINE TORN DOWN FOR INSPECTION BY THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE. THE TSB IS NOT INTENDING TO CARRY OUT ANY FURTHER ACTION AT THIS TIME. THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE HEAD OFFICE COORDINATOR WHEN AVAILABLE.Update: 14 APR. 2000An Engineering analysis of the engine was carried out at Air Kinetic Ltd. facility in Richmond BC; with the TSB observing.  Northern Mountain Helicopters the owner/operator of this engine were in attendance and also represented by R.J.Waldron.  Representatives from 'Airborne Engines'(Repair & Overhaul facility that last inspected the engine) were invited and participated.The engine was a Lycoming T53-13B turbine S/N:LE07610.  It was on its second TBO Extension with about 220 Hours remaining (TSN=9457.2 hrs. and TSO=4600.8 hrs.).  R.J.WALDRON determined that: while in a climb configuration and without warning there was a failure of a first stage power turbine blade tip shroud.  The tip failure likely caused one or more secondary failures prior to penetrating the outer shroud of the nozzle.  Continued operation with loose objects resulted in a cascading progressive break-up of the power turbine section.  There was a loss of N2 (Power Turbine) rotational speed which the fuel system sensed and responded to by scheduling an increased fuel flow.  The low N2 speed and high fuel flow caused a rapid and excessive increase in the turbine temperature.  This overtemperature condition caused severe thermal degradation of the gas producer components and high temperature failure of the gas producer blade tips.  Further flight was not possible and an autorotation to the first available location was necessary.Deposits of light tan powdered material were found in the turbine section.  These were analysed and confirmed the presence of high concentrations of silicon calcium sulphur aluminum potassium iron chromium and nickel.  It is known that damage of turbine components in the form of sulphidation may occur by the presence of sulphur and potassium.  In view of the presence of sulphur and potassium in the turbine coupled with a severe degradation of the turbine components metallurgical samples were examined.  No evidence of sulphidation was found.  The degradation of the components was due to high temperature oxidation and incipient melting associated with an overtemperature event. A sample of Jet fuel collected from the helicopter [C-FKHQ] was analysed at Powertech Labs Inc. and compared with a sample of Jet A fuel to determine if it was contaminated with an incompatible fuel or solvent.  It was also analysed for corrosive sulphur.  The appearance of both samples were clear and bright.  Gas Chromatography revealed that the fuel from China had a pattern that was typical of a petroleum middle distillate type fuel.  It was similar to the Jet A control sample except that it was a lighter cut.  The final boiling range of the fuel from China was that of a C15 hydrocarbon.  The final boiling point of the Jet A product was that of a C18 hydrocarbon.  There was no indication of gasoline solvents or summer diesel fuel in the samples.   ,No,Unknown,C-FKHQ,HELICOPTER,BELL HELICOPTER,NORTHERN MOUNTAIN HELICOPTERS,COMMERCIAL,2251-5700 KG    (4961-12565 LBS),,LIGHT,1969,1,SUBSTANTIAL,HELISLINGING,

MONTREAL ACC CALLED THE MONCTON OSS AND ADVISED THEM THAT DAL31 WAS NOW 59N/60W DIRECT TAFFY.  THIS ROUTING RESULTED IN DAL31 CONVERGING WITH AAL67 TRACK AFTER ENTERING MONCTON ACC AIRSPACE ABOUT 6 MINUTES AFTER TURNING SOUTH FROM POSITION 59N/60W.THE MONCTON OSS PRINTED OUT A DATA STRIP FOR DAL31.  THIS STRIP WENT TO THE DATA BOARD FOR THE APPLICABLE SECTOR.  THE DATA MAN DID NOT DETECT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN DAL31 AND AAL67.WHEN DAL31 WAS CLEARED FROM POSITION 59N/60W DIRECT TAFFY BY MONTREAL ACC THE REQUIRED OCEANIC SEPARATION OF 60 NM WAS LOST.THE SAGLEK RADAR WAS NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO SCHEDUELED RADAR SITE MAINTENANCE.  BASED ON PROJECTIONS OF TRACK AND AIRSPEED BOTH DAL31 AND AAL67 PASSED 44 MILES WEST OF MOATT AT 1703 UTC.AT 1703 UTC AAL67 WAS CLEARED FROM FL370 FOR FL390 DUE TO LOWER TRAFFIC REQUEST FOR FL370. DAL31 CONTACTED MONCTON ACC AT 1704:35 UTC AND THEN REPORTED THEIR POSITION AT 1705:29 AFTER THEY HAD CROSSED SOUTH OF THE AAL67 TRACK.  AT THIS TIME THE CONTROLLER DETECTED THE LOSS OF SEPARATION HOWEVER AAL67 WAS CLIMBING TO FL390.  THE CONFLICT WAS RESOLVED WHEN AAL67 REACHED FL390 AND THE 2000 FT VERTICAL SEPARATION REQUIREMENT WAS MET.NEITHER AIRCRAFT RECEIVED A TCAS ALERT.A PROCEDURAL CHANGE WAS INSTITUTED AT MONCTON ACC SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER.  THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ESTIMATES FOR AIRCRAFT ENTERING MONCTON ACC AIRSPACE WERE PASSED TO THE MONCTON OPERATIONAL SUPPORT STAFF (OSS) BY THE CENTER CONTROLLING THE AIRCRAFT.  THE OSS OPERATORS PRODUCED THE DATA STRIPS BUT ONLY THE CONTROLLER RECEIVING THE STRIP AT THE SECTOR BOARD COULD ACCEPT THE INBOUND TRAFFIC AFTER SCANNING THE BOARD FOR POSSIBLE CONFLICTS.  IF A CONFLICT WAS DETECTED THE CONTROLLER WOULD ADVISE THE CENTER WHO CALLED IN THE ESTIMATE THAT THE ROUTING WAS UNACCEPTABLE.THE OLD PROCEDURE HAD THE ESTIMATE CALLED IN DIRECTLY TO THE SECTOR CONTROLLER WHO WOULD ACCEPT OR REJECT THE ROUTING BEFORE THE MONCTON OSS PRODUCED THE DATA STRIP.  THE OLD PROCEDURE RESULTED IN THE SECTOR CONTROLLER SCANNING THE DATA BOARD TWICE FOR POSSIBLE CONFLICTS.

The pilot was unable to restart the engine so the engine was shut down. Maintenance personnel determined that the high-pressure fuel pump had failed; the HP fuel pump and the fuel control unit were replaced. Engineering Memorandum No. 3-6273-00 from Air Canada advises that the fuel pump failed as a result of looseness developing in the clamp assembly which secures the pump to the gear box. This caused excessive drive shaft spline wear. A fleet-wide campaign was initiated for inspection of all B747 and B767 aircraft engines having similar fuel pumps. Any pumps found loose were to be scheduled for removal and corrective action as required. Le moteur numero un s'est eteint en vol en croisiere. Le pilote n'a pu le redemarrer et il en a coupe l'allumage. Le personnel du service de maintenance a determine que la pompe a carburant haute pression est tombee en panne. La pompe en question et le regulateur de carburant ont ete remplaces. D'apres la Note de service technique numero 3-6273-00 d'Air Canada la pompe a carburant est tombee en panne parce que le collet de fixation de la pompe au boitier d'engrenages s'etait desserre. Il s'en est suivi une usure excessive de l'arbre d'entrainement cannele. Une campagne a l'echelle de la flotte a ete lancee pour que tous les reacteurs des B747 et des B767 equipes de pompes a carburant similaires soient inspectes.

ROC / LOS,10:30:00,INCIDENT,,3/19/1985 12:00:00 AM,UNKNOWN,ATLANTIC,"A DC-10 and an IL62 westbound across the North Atlantic experienced a loss of separation when the IL62 was cleared by Gander Oceanic Control to climb through the altitude of the DC-10 (FL330). An invalid 20-degree west estimate on the DC-10 was sent from Shanwick Oceanic Control. The data strip used by the Gander controller who issued the climb clearance was based on this invalid time. The primary protection for discovering this type of error is the actual 20-degree west position report. This report on the DC-10 was placed in an \actioned\"" basket without being actioned. The Unit Operations Manual procedure of coordinating climb clearances within 20 minutes of the common boundary (Shanwick/Gander) was not followed. The two aircraft had approximately one minute of longitudinal separation when the IL62 climbed through FL350. The original error in Shanwick was made when the automatic data transfer system was unserviceable and manual inputs were being made. The actual  20-degree west position report was stuck to the back of an actioned report and was placed in an \""actioned\"" basket. The controller who issued the climb clearance was using a 10-minute coordination instead of the 20-minute standard. FINDINGS: Cause Related: 1. The proposed 20-degree west time for the DC-10 which was sent from Shanwick to Gander was in error. 2. The actual 20-degree west position report from the DC-10 was not actioned. 3. The 20-minute coordination standard which is outlined in the Unit Operations Manual was not followed. 4. The two aircraft had approximately one minute of longitudinal separation when the IL62 climbed through FL350. Other: -Nil- L'espacement reglementaire entre le DC-10 et l'IL62 en direction ouest sur l'Atlantique nord n'a pas ete respecte lorsque le controle oceanique de Gander a autorise l'IL62 a monter au-dessus de l'altitude du DC-10 (FL330). Une erreur dans l'heure prevue d'arrivee du DC-10 au meridien 20deg ouest a ete transmise par le controle oceanique de Shanwick. La fiche de vol utilisee par le controleur de Gander qui a accorde l'autorisation de monter etait fondee sur cette heure prevue erronee. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective au meridien 20deg ouest est la principale methode de deceler une erreur du genre. Le compte rendu initial avait ete place par erreur dans la panier \""mesures prises\"". Les consignes etablies dans le manuel d'exploitation de l'unite precisent que la coordination des montees doit avoir lieu dans les 20 minutes de longitude qui precedent l'arrivee a la limite Shanwick/Gander mais elles n'ont pas ete suivies. Lorsque l'IL62 a traverse le FL350 en montee  leur espacement longitudinal n'etait que d'environ une minute. L'erreur initiale commise a Shanwick s'est produite lorsque le systeme de transfert automatique des donnees est tombe en panne et que les entrees ont du etre faites a la main. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective au meridien 20deg ouest a ete depose dans le panier \""mesures prises\"" parce qu'il s'etait colle a l'arriere d'un compte rendu deja traite. Le controleur qui a accorde l'autorisation de monter avait coordonne l'espacement apres 10 minutes de longitude au lieu des 20 minutes reglementaires. CONCLUSIONS Faits etablis se rapportant aux causes: 1. L'heure prevue d'arrivee du DC-10 au meridien 20deg W transmise a Gander par Shanwick etait erronee. 2. Le compte rendu d'arrivee effective du DC-10 au meridien 20deg ouest n'a pas ete traite. 3. La norme de coordination etablie a 20 minutes de longitude prescrite dans le manuel d'exploitation de l'unite n'a pas ete respectee. 4. Les deux aeronefs avaient un  espacement logitudinal d'environ une minute lorsque l'IL62 a traverse le FL350 en montee.

HE GAVE HIS POSITION AS 68 NM SOUTH OF BARBADOS AND SAID HE WAS DIVERTING TO THAT ISLAND. FORTY FOUR MINUTES LATER HE MADE HIS LAST TRANSMISSION AND REPORTED HE WAS AT 50 FT. NO TRACE OF THE A/C WAS FOUND DESPITE AN INTENSIVE SEARCH MOUNTED BY BARBADOS. THE A/C HAD DEPARTED FROM TIMEHRI AIRPORT IN GUYANA ON A VFR FLIGHT PLAN TO ANTIGUA ENROUTE TO CANADA. CONSIDERABLE CARGO WAS CARRIED INCLUDING TWO SPARE ENGINES ONE EXTRA PROPELLER AND OTHER SPARE PARTS. THE ONLY OVERWATER SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT ON BOARD WAS FOUR LIFE JACKETS. WITNESSES SAW THE A/C BEING LOADED AND SAW THE PILOTS AND PASSENGER EMBARK. A NUMBER OF RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE FLIGHT THE FIRST BEING RECEIVED IN GUYANA AT 1835Z AND THE BALANCE BY PILOTS OF OTHER A/C. THE TRANSMISSION TO GUYANA INDICATED SIMPLY THAT ALL WAS WELL. THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSMISSIONS  ADVISED OF THE ENGINE FAILURE THE OVERHEATING OF THE OTHER ENGINE THE ESTIMATED POSITION AND THE INTENTION TO DIVERT TO BARBADOS AND GAVE THE ALTITUDE AS 1500 FT. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT ENGINE POWER SETTINGS AND FINALLY A TRANSMISSION AT 1939Z SAYING THEY WERE DOWN TO 50 FT. THE PILOT OF ANOTHER A/C REPORTED THAT HE WAS IN THE VICINITY AT 14000 FT AND DESCRIBED THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AS GOOD WITH LIGHT CUMULUS CLOUDS. HE SAID THE WATER COULD BE SEEN AT ALL TIMES. HE INDICATED HE HAD CALLED THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM BARBADOS AND THAT THE PILOT OF THE CARIBOU HAD REPLIED IMMEDIATELY. THE A/C HAD NOT BEEN FLOWN FOR 15 MONTHS EXCEPT FOR AN 18 MIN TEST FLIGHT THE DAY BEFORE BUT REPORTEDLY THE ENGINES HAD BEEN RUN-UP ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE ENGINES HAD BEEN OPERATED ONLY 70 AND 120 HRS SINCE OVERHAUL. INITIAL INFORMATION AND CALCULATIONS BASED ON STANDARD WEIGHTS FOR THE A/C TYPE INDICATED THAT AN OVERLOAD WAS A POSSIBILITY.  SUBSEQUENTLY CONVINCING EVIDENCE WAS OBTAINED FROM WITNESSES PRESENT DURING THE DEPARTURE PREPARATIONS AND FROM AN OFFICIAL WEIGHT AND BALANCE REPORT FOR THE PARTICULAR A/C. THIS ESTABLISHED THAT THE DEPARTURE WEIGHT DID NOT EXCEED THE AUTHORIZED MAXIMUM FIGURE OF 28500 LBS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ONE ENGINE FAILED IN FLIGHT AND THE REMAINING ENGINE OVERHEATED BOTH FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS AND THAT THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN FLIGHT WITH THE REDUCED POWER AVAILABLE.   ,Yes,Unknown,C-GVYW,AEROPLANE,DE HAVILLAND,,COMMERCIAL,27001-272000 KG (59526-599650 LBS),TRICYCLE ALL RETRACT,MEDIUM,1970,2,DESTROYED,FERRY,

HE MADE HIS APPROACH TO THE WEST AND REALIZED THAT THE SETTING SUN WAS REDUCING HIS FORWARD VISIBILITY. HE DECIDED TO LAND ABOUT 700-1000 FEET LONG TO AVOID AN UNDERSHOOT KNOWING THAT HE STILL HAD 2300 FEET TO GO. THE ROLL OUT WAS DESCRIBED AS NORMAL AND THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED HOWEVER WITH 1000 FEET OF RUNWAY REMAINING THE PILOT REALIZED THAT HE WAS GOING TOO FAST. THE AIRCRAFT RAN OFF THE STRIP TRAVELLED 350 FEET DOWN A DIRT ROAD AND STRUCK A PLYWOOD PUMPHOUSE. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE BRAKES TO SLOW THE AIRPLANE APPRECIABLY.
